		<p>Being a patronymic name it represents anyone who is a descendant of the sage Babhru. The sage Girija of the <i>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa</i> and the sage Śaṅkha of <i>Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa</i> were Bābhravyas.</p>
		<p>The sage Gālava, mentioned in the Mahābhārata, was also a Bābhravya. He was a great yogi and had organized the science of euphony of the Vedas (called Śikṣā).</p> 
		<p>The <i>Skāndapurāṇa</i>, mentions a Bābhravya. Arjuna, the Pāṇḍava hero, during his pilgrimage, met Bābhravya and heard from him about the greatness of the sage Nārada.</p>
		<p>One Bābhravya is said to have produced a condensed version of Kāmaśāstra (the Science of Erotics), originally written by Śvetaketu.</p>

		<p>When Arjuna, the Pāṇḍava hero, was on a tour, as penance, he went to the kingdom of Citravāhana, ruling at Maṇalūr. The king offered his daughter Citrāṅgadā in marriage to him. Babhruvahana was the son born to them. He grew up into a great warrior worthy of his father.</p>
		<p>After the Kurukṣetra war, when Yudhiṣṭhira decided to perform the Aśvamedha sacrifice, Arjuna escorted the sacrificial horse through various kingdoms. The horse was caught by Babhruvāhana; and in the ensuing fight Arjuna was killed by him, but was revived by Ulūpī, another wife of Arjuna, by placing the Sañjīvakamaṇi, a precious stone capable of reviving dead persons, on his chest.</p>
		<p>Babhruvāhana attended the Aśvamedha sacrifice at Hastināpura.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>Nestling at the foot of steep hills, this small town is situated in the Bijapur district of Karnataka State. Known as Vātāpi in the ancient days, it was the capital of the Cālukyan empire during the period A.D. 550-753. It contains several temples of the structural as well as the rock-cut varieties. Near the fort there are temples dedicated to Hanumān and Śiva. On the southern hill, situated on its western side, there are four cave-temples (three Hindu and one Jain). They resemble the ones at Ellora. The pillared halls in them show a high standard of workmanship and are uniformly of the same appearance. The pillars are mostly square in section though a few of the inner colonnade in Cave no.3 are multifaceted.</p>
		<p>In the first cave are seen images of Śiva with 18 arms, Gaṇeśa, Viṣṇu, Lakṣmī as also Śiva-Pārvatī. The back wall contains panel-figures of Mahiṣāsuramardinī (Durgā), Gaṇeśa and Skanda. The second cave contains images of Vāmana, Varāha, Nārāyaṇa on Garuḍa and Nārāyaṇa on the serpent Śeṣa. The third cave has images and figures of Ardhanārīśvara, Pārvatī, Narasiṁha and Varāha. The fourth cave contains the images of the Jain Tīrthaṅkaras.</p>
		<p>Among the structural temples, the Mālegitti Śivālaya built on a hill overlooking the town of Bādāmi needs special mention. It is a massive solid structure, though not very large. It consists of a cella, an assembly hall and a porch.</p>
		<p>There are fine frescos, very much like those of Ajanta, in Cave no. 3. The most important and well-preserved of these is that of the betrothal of Pārvatī to Śiva. These paintings belong to the 6th century A. D.</p>

		<p>Vedanta is the last of the six systems of Indian philosophy. Bādarāyaṇa is stated to be its author. Hindu tradition identifies him with Veda-Vyāsa (also known as Kṛṣna Dvaipāyana), the celebrated author of the <i>Mahābhārata</i>. Lexicographers like Hemacandra (A. D. 1088-1173) (<i>vide</i> his <i>Abhidhānacintāmaṇi-Martyakāṇḍa</i>, 512) support this view. Since he lived along with his disciples and son Śuka, at the Badarī in the Himālayas, he might have used this name in his composition, the <i>Brahmasūtras</i>.</p>
		<p>Bādarāyaṇa appears in the <i>Sāmavidhāna, Brāhmaṇa</i> of the Sāmaveda. Varāhamihira (A. D. 505-587) and Bhaṭṭotpala (10th cent. A. D.) well-known astronomers, have mentioned another Bādarāyaṇa in their works. But, they are different from Bādarāyaṇa-Vyāsa.</p>

		<span class="word">Badarīnātha</span> <span class="word_def">('Lord of Badarī')</span>
	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>Tīrthayātrā or pilgrimage to holy places has been an age-old exercise undertaken by the pious Hindus. The Himālayas and the river Gaṅgā have so captivated the Hindu mind for generations that a majority of these places of pilgrimage is associated with them. Badarīnātha, also spelt as Badrināth, situated in the Chamoli district of Uttaranchal, is one of the most important of these and has been classed among the 'Caturdhamas' (the four Holy Places), the other three being Dvārakā in Western India, Purī in Eastern India and Rāmeśvaram in South India. A visit to these four places has been a life-time's ambition of many a devout Hindu since it is as good as covering all important places of pilgrimage in the country.</p>
		<p>The place itself might have derived its name from the existence of Badarī or the jujube tree in plenty in that area.</p>
		<p>Even from the most ancient days, Badarīnātha has been considered as very sacred. It was known as Badarikāśrama. It was here that the twin sages, Nara-Nārāyaṇa, had built their hermitage and performed severe austerities. The sage Parāśara and Vyāsa, the celebrated author of the Mahābhārata, lived here with their disciples. Consequently Vyāsa got the by-name Bādarāyaṇa.</p>
		<p>The town is situated at a height of about 7000 metres (23,300 ft.), in a valley nearly 6 kms. long and 2 kms. wide (4 miles by 1.3 miles). The temple is on the right bank of the river Alakanandā.</p> 
		<p>The original temple is said to have been built by Śaṅkāracārya in the 8th century A.D., after recovering the old image from the Nārada Kuṇḍa (pond). Over the centuries, avalanches washed out many a temple and the present one is comparatively a modern structure.</p>
		<p>Near the temple is a hot-water pond called 'Taptakuṇḍa', with a thermal spring of sulphurous waters. A bath here is a must, before the visit to the temple.</p>
		<p>The temple of Lord Nārāyaṇa is about 13.5 metres (45 ft.) in height and faces east. There is a golden kalasa or pinnacle on the top. The image inside the temple is made of 'śālagrāmaśilā' or black stone. It is in the padmāsana or seated posture, with four arms, carrying the well-known symbols śaṅkha (conch), cakra (discus), gadā (mace) and padma (lotus). Other images found in the temple are those of Nara and Nārāyaṇa, Uddhava, Nārada, Garuḍa and Kubera.</p>
		<p>The chief priest called 'Rāval' is a Nambūdiri brāhmaṇa from Kerala, as per the traditions established by Śaṅkarācārya.</p>
		<p>The temple, being situated among the mountains of the Himālayan snow range, is open to the devotees only for about six months (April-May to November). The utsavamūrti (image used in temple processions) is shifted to the temple of Narasiṁha at Joshimath, a place situated at a distance of 48 kms (31 miles) from Badarinath and worshipped there during the winter months. The chief priest and his entourage also shift to this place for this purpose. The 'Jyotirmaṭha,' one of the four principal monasteries established by Śaṅkarācārya is also situated here.</p>
		<p>Lord Badarīnātha is worshipped in five different places. Hence they are collectively called 'Pañcabadarīs.' They are: Viśāla Badarī (the main Badarīnath); Yogadhyāna Badarī (at Pāṇḍukeśvara, about 24 kms. [16 miles] away from Badarīnath); Bhaviṣya Badarī (near Tapovana, about 17 kms. [11 miles] away from the Joshimath); Vṛddha Badarī (at Animath, 17 kms. from Joshimath in the direction of Pipalkot) and Ādi Badarī (about 16 kms. [10 miles] from Karṇaprayāg on the road to Rāṇikhet).</p> 
		<p>It is believed that if śrāddha (obsequial ceremonies) is offered here at the place called 'Brahmakapāla' on the bank of Alakanandā to the dead ancestors, they are liberated at once. Hence it is no more necessary to continue the annual śrāddhas.</p>

		<span class="word">bādha</span> <span class="word_def">('that which contradicts')</span>
	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>The word has several meanings: abhāva or absence; pratibandha or obstacle; pīḍā or harassment. However, it is the Nyāya school (of Indian Philosophy) that uses it as a technical term of logic.</p> 
		<p>In the sentence, <i>parvato vahnimān dhūmāt</i> ('The hill is fiery, since there is smoke there'), vahni or fire is called 'sādhya' (the major term), parvata or hill is called 'pakṣa' (the minor term) and dhūma or smoke as 'hetu' or 'liṅga' (the middle term).</p>
		<p>In a situation where the sādhya does not exist in the pakṣa, then the pakṣa is called bādha. For instance, in the sentence <i>hrado vahnimān dhūmāt</i> ('The lake is fiery, since there is smoke there') the minor term hrada or lake, which is the pakṣa, is 'bādha' since it is impossible for the fire, the sādhya, to exist in the lake. The lake obstructs or prevents (bādha = obstacle) fire from existing in it.</p>
		<p>Many more varieties of bādha are discussed in the works of Indian logic.</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>In the Nyāya school of Indian philosophy, a material fallacy is technically called 'hetvābhāsa,' which literally means that a hetu or reason which appears as, but really is not, a valid reason. Out of the five hetvābhāsas generally listed, 'bādhita' is the last.</p>
		<p>Consider the sentence <i>agniranuṣṇaḥ dravyatvāt</i>, 'Fire is cold, since it is a substance'. Here anuṣṇatva or coldness is the sādhya (major term) and dravya or substance is the hetu (middle term). The non-existence of coldness, nay more, the existence of hotness, is perceived in fire by our sense of touch. So, we have to reject hetu or the middle term, dravyatva (being a substance), as it is bādhita or contradicted by another means of knowledge (here, pratyakṣa or direct perception).</p>

	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>Among the various types of Vedic sacrifices, the Somayāga is an important one. It derives its name from the fact that the juice of the soma creeper is used as oblation. This juice is pressed out of the creepers by stones or mortar and pestle, and is purified by being passed slowly through a strainer of sheep's wool. It is then transferred to jars and mixed with milk.</p>
		<p>There are three savanas or 'pressings&#8212;moming, noon and evening, known respectively as prātas-savana, mādhyandina-savana and tṛtīya-savana.</p>
		<p>The Bahiṣpavamāna is the stotra or hymn that is chanted during the prātassavana. Since it is outside (bahir = outside) the sadas or the assembly hall, it is called Bahiṣpavamāna.</p>
		<p>It consists of three tṛcas or triplets of Ṛgvedic mantras (9.11.1-3; 9.64.28-30; 9.66.10-12) making a total of nine verses. These verses are sung as Sāmans (Sāmavedic chants) in a special style called 'trivṛt' wherein the first verse of each triplet is chanted first followed by the second and the third. If the verses of each triplet are symbolically represented as a,b and c, the scheme of chanting will be thus: a1+a2+a3; b1+b2+b3+; c1+c2+c3.</p>
		<p>In sum, these verses welcome the deity presiding over the soma juice, beg him to protect the family and property of the sacrificer and describe the graceful flow of the juice through the strainer.</p>

Arjuna, the Pāṇḍava hero, conquered this country during his victory marches before the Rājasūya sacrifice. The people of this country had come in for a lot of criticism due to their unethical ways of life (<i>Karṇaparva</i> 44). The <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> (<i>Ayodhyākāṇḍa</i> 68.18) alludes to a country called Bāhlīka, situated between Ayodhyā and Kekaya, which again extended between the rivers Śatadrū (Sutlej) and Vipāśā (Beas).</p> 
		<p>The word Bāhlīka also refers to the king of that country who fought for Duryodhana against the Pāṇḍavas. There is also the mention of another Bāhlīka, younger brother of king Śantanu, the father of Bhīṣma.</p>

Śaṅkha and Likhita, the brothers whose <i>Smṛti</i> has earned a place for itself in the dharmaśāstra literature, were men of such sterling character. Once Likhita, the younger brother, went to the hermitage of Śaṅkha and ate some fruits from the garden without his prior permission. He realized the mistake which amounted to stealing and confessed the same to Śaṅkha. Śaṅkha sent him to the king Sudyumna. The king cut off his arms as a punishment. Likhita returned to Śaṅkha who approved of the punishment, but directed him to take a bath in the nearby river. When Likhita did so, he regained his arms. Since then, the river got the name 'Bāhudā,' 'that which gave arms'. It is identified with a river near Ayodhyā.</p>

		<p>Bahulā (also known as Bahulācaturthī) is one of the minor festivals observed in the northern parts of India on the fourth day of the dark fortnight (kṛṣṇa-caturthī) of the month of Bhādra (September). It is generally observed by women who have children. After the usual fasting and prayers as prescribed for such festivals, a cow with a calf is worshipped in the evening and also offered some sweets in an earthen pot. Fast can be broken only after that, with cooked barley. An observance of this festival with its vows is said to confer children and wealth on the votary.</p>
		<p>This festival is connected with two folk tales: A cow was caught by a hungry lion, begged the lion to allow it to feed its little calf at home and then return. The lion obliged and the cow returned, true to its promise. Moved by its devotion to truth, the lion let it go. It was on this day that the truthful cow was liberated by the lion.</p>
		<p>A lady, Vipulā by name, took the dead body of her young husband on a raft by a river called Bahulā, to the world of the serpent goddess Manasā and got him revived on this day. Hence, listening to this story on this day gives religious merit.</p>

		<p>The literal meaning of the word 'bala' is 'strength.' However, the word is often used in a metaphorical sense, as for instance in statements like 'dhigbalaṁ kṣattriyabalaṁ brahmatejobalaṁ balam;' ('Fie be unto the power of the kṣattriya! The power of lustre of Brahman is verily the power!'). There are other interesting statements such as: vāṇijya (trade) is the bala of a vaiśya; yuddha (war) is the bala of a kṣattriya; dhana (wealth) is the bala of a rich man; rodana (crying) is the bala of a child; anṛta (falsehood) is the bala of thieves; Paramātman (God) is the bala of devotees and so on.</p>
		<p>Works on Hindu political science like the <i>Arthaśāstra</i> of Kauṭilya (300 B.C.) declare that a rājya or state is constituted by seven elements like svāmin (ruler or sovereign), amātya (minister), janapada or rāṣṭra (the territory of the State and its people) and so on. Daṇḍa or bala (armed forces) is one of these seven constituents</p>
		<p>Most of the ancient and early medieval works state that a big army should consist of four constituents; hence the name 'caturaṅga-bala,' 'armed forces with four parts'. They are hasti (elephants), aśva (horses), ratha (chariots) and padāti (foot-soldiers).</p>
		<p>The works also mention six kinds of troops: maula (hereditary troops), bhṛta or bhṛtaka (mercenary troops), śreṇi (guild troops), mitra (troops of an ally), amitra (troops that once belonged to an enemy) and aṭavī or āṭavika (wild tribes as troops). The earlier varieties of troops are superior to the later ones</p>
		<p>The <i>Mahābhārata</i> declares that out of the several balas of a king like bāhubala (brute force), dhanabala (power of wealth), amātyabala (power due to the right type of ministers) and so on, prajñābala (power of wisdom) is the greatest (<i>Udyogaparua</i> 37.52~55).</p>

		<p>Worship of Śakti or the Mother Goddess is a very ancient practice in India. Of the several aspects of the Divine Mother Pārvatī, Lalitā or Lalitā-Tripurasundarī is very important and popular. Bālā (also called Bālā-Tripurasundarī) is an aspect of this Lalitā. Sometimes she is described as the daughter of Lalitā who helped her to destroy the army of the demon Bhaṇḍāsura.</p>
		<p>As her very name suggests, Bālā is pictured as an eternal girl of nine years. Iconographical works describe her as red in colour like hibiscus flower. She has four arms carrying akṣamālā (rosary), pāśa (noose), aṇkuśa (goad) and pustaka (book).</p>
		<p>Bālā is specially worshipped, by those desiring psychic powers</p>

		<p>Among the luminaries of the Bhakti Movement that energized the Hindu masses during the middle ages, the greatest, perhaps, was Śrīkṛṣṇa Caitanya (A.D. 1485-1533), more commonly known as Caitanya Mahāprabhu. His teachings gradually got metamorphosed into a system of philosophy, now well-known as the <i>Acintyabhedābheda</i> school. Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa who lived in the early 18th century, is an important writer of this school. He was born in a village near Remuna in Orissa. He was a pupil of Vairāgi Pītāmbara Dāsa. Out of the 14
		works attributed to him, the <i>Govindabhāṣya</i>, a commentary on the <i>Brahmasūtras</i> is most well-known. It has a subcommentary called <i>Sūkṣma</i>, the author of which is unknown</p>

He was nicknamed 'Dṛpta-Bālāki' since he was a vain person (dṛpta = vain). He had mastered one aspect of the knowledge of Brahman. He went to the King Ajātaśatru of Kāśī and expressed his desire to teach him. The King, who was more learned, and could see through his vanity, proved his superiority.

	<div class="mng">
		<p>Pātaka (sin) and prāyaścitta (expiation of sin) are two of the widely discussed topics in the smṛtis and dharmaśāstras. Sins may be serious (mahāpātakas) or minor (upapātakas). The prāyaścittas prescribed for the mahāpātakas like killing a brāhmaṇa or incest, often end in the death of the sinner. But, those prescribed for the upapātakas like minor thefts or abandoning the Vedic fires, are tolerable and purify the sinners.</p>
		<p>Kṛcchra is a very general name given to most of these prāyaścittas. Bālakṛcchra&#8212;also called śiśukṛcchra or laghukṛcchra&#8212;is one variety prescribed for upapātakas in which the expiation is light and easy. If kṛcchras are usually spread over 12 days, bālakṛcchra is observed only for 4 days. It consists in eating once only in day time on the first day, once only in the night on the second day, eating food that comes unasked, that too only once, on the third day and, fasting on the fourth day. Other general rules as applicable to kṛcchras like bathing thrice daily, speaking the truth and so on, should also be followed.</p>

		<p>Smṛtis are secondary scriptures which expound dharma, in consonance with the Śruti or the Vedas. If the Śruti gives the general spiritual truths, the smrtis give elaborate details pertaining to the code of conduct of an individual member of the society both at the personal and at the social level. One of the earliest smṛtis that ranks on almost equal terms with the <i>Manusmṛti</i>, is the <i>Yājñavalkya Smṛti</i>. This work has two well-known commentaries: the Mitākṣarā of Vijñāneśvara (12th cent. A.D.) and the Bālakrīḍā of Viśvarūpa (9th cent. A. D.).</p> 
		<p>Being earlier than the <i>Mitākṣarā</i>, the <i>Bālakrīḍā</i> is a pioneering work. Its author, Viśvarūpa shows a good grasp of the Pūrvamīmāṁsā terms and logic, but seems to lean towards the advaita of Śaṅkara (A. D. 788 .. 820) where philosophical ideas are concerned.</p>
		<p>Some scholars opine that Viśvarūpa and Sureśvara, a disciple of Śaṅkara, are identical, 'Viśvarūpa' being his premonastic name.</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>Hindu temples, with their images, are built with materials like stone, so that they can last long. Due to the ravages of time, weather, accidents or any other cause, when the temple structure or the image is damaged, needing repair or replacement, provision has been made in the āgamas for the necessary ritualistic processes to transfer the 'kalā' or the power of the deity temporarily through a kalaśa (consecrated pitcher of water) to a new image and installed in a new temple provisionally built for the purpose. Once the renovation work is over, the 'kalā' is transferred back to the old renovated temple and image.</p>
		<p>The temporary structure put up for this purpose to house the deity during the renovation work, so that the usual rituals can go on undisturbed, is technically called 'bālālaya' or 'the little temple', since it is 'small' compared to the original structure. It is generally built in the front of the old temple, but to its left side, and its door facing that of the old one. It should have both a garbhagṛha (<i>sanctum sanctorum</i>) and a maṇḍapa (hall) attached to it. The image may be made of either metal or wood. The entire process of consecration of the bālālaya is identical with that of any newly built temple. Once the old temple is renovated, the kalā is transferred back to the old image in the renovated shrine or to the new image installed there, if the old one had been damaged necessitating replacement. After this, the image of the bālālaya has to be burnt, if of wood, or melted, if of metal, and presented to the ācārya or preceptor. The old image of the original temple, if replaced, should be taken in a procession and immersed deeply in sea or river or lake.</p>

		<p>Śakti or divine power of God is often pictured as a goddess, as the consort of the Deity. For instance, Pārvatī is the power of Śiva, personified as his consort. Out of the several such goddesses, all being the aspects of the supreme Śakti, Balapramathirī is a minor one. Since Sūrya or Sun is hot and enervating, this deity represents the Sun as a tattva or principle. She is pictured as white or reddish in complexion and has two hands carrying a kapāla (skull) and a pāśa (noose). She is the destroyer of all enemies and hence propitiated as such.
