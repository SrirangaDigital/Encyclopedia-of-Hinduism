	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>Derived from the root `dhā' (to support, to sustain) the word `dadhi' represents curds (curdled milk or yoghurt), since, perhaps, it is considered to be a better food item than milk in sustaining the health of the body.</p>
		<p>It has important uses in Vedic sacrifices. It is used to curdle fresh, hot, milk which is used as oblation and also consumed by the sacrificer in the Darśa sacrifice. So also in the Āgrayaṇa rite. In the animal sacrifice (Paśubandha) it is utilised to prepare pṛṣadājya (a mixture of curds and ghee) used for sprinkling over the immolated animal. It is expected to be consumed by the sacrificer in the dīkṣā rite (consecration of the sacrificer in a Soma sacrifice).</p>
		<p>`Dadhigraha' refers to the drawing of curds offered to Prajāpati just before the morning pressing of the soma juice.</p>
		<p>`Dadhigharma' is a beverage of hot milk and curdled milk poured into a warm pot by the adhvaryu priest and used as a libation at the midday pressing of the soma juice in a Somayāga. `Dadhimantha' is a beverage of grains (saktu) mixed with curds, also used in sacrifices.</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>Dadhīci (also spelt as `Dadhīca') was a great sage who willingly sacrificed his life to help the gods conquer their eternal foes, the asuras.</p>
		<p>Once the gods deposited their various weapons with the sage Dadhīci for safe custody. But they did not return in the stipulated time. Since the weapons were getting rusted and were crumbling, the sage dissolved them in water and drank the same. They got merged in his backbone making it immensely strong. When the gods, under the leadership of their king Indra came back and asked for the return of their weapons, Dadhīci told them what he had done. Since they requested for his backbone, out of which a great weapon could be made and with shich their formidable foe, Vṛtrāsura, could be killed, he immediately obliged them by giving up his body in yoga. Indra's Vajrāyudha (thunderbolt) was prepared out of it.</p>
		<p>Dadhīci stands for the highest ideal of self-sacrifice for social good.</p>
		<p>He was the son of Atharvaṇa and Śānti. The well-known sage Pippalāda of Upaniṣadic fame was his son.</p>

		<p>The political and social turmoil in medieval India was also responsible&#8212;though in a strange and inscrutable way&#8212;to throw up many a great saint who tried by their lives and teachings, to show that the true spirit of religion lies in inner mystical experience and not in dry rituals or meaningless formalities.</p>
		<p>Dādū (A. D. 1544-1603) was one of the brighter stars of this period and the most famous of the followers of Kabīr's (A. D. 1440-1518) ideals. Born in Ahmedabad (in Gujarat) he seems to have spent most of his time in Rajasthan. He passed away in the village Narāṇā (or Nārāyaṇa) of Rajasthan, where his followers&#8212;known as `Dādūpanthis'&#8212;have their chief centre even now.</p>
		<p>He established the `Brahma or Parabrahma Sampradāya' with a view to uniting all the divergent faiths in one bond of love and friendship.</p>
		<p>He did not believe in the authority of the scriptures but in the value of realisation. He laid great stress on the cultivation of virtues like humility, compassion, fearlessness, forgiveness and firmness in one's path.</p>
		<p>He was a householder and believed that the natural life of the householder was best suited for spiritual realisation.</p>
		<p>His children too (two sons and two daughters) were persons of high spiritual calibre.</p>
		<p>At his request, his disciples made (in A. D. 1600) a collection of the devotional writings of all the different sects. This anthology, containing the sayings of many Muslim saints also, helped the spiritual aspirants of all types in their journey towards perfection.</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>Right from the Vedic days Hindus have been rather fastidious in choosing `good' days and avoiding `bad' days for the starting of any venture. Even now, even the average Hindu, is very particular about this.</p>
		<p>Such days are generally decided with the help of astrologers and priests who consult the pañcāṅga (the almanac) and give their opinion. One of the inauspicious days mentioned there, is called `dagdhayoga'. If the week days from Sunday to Saturday occur on certain tithis (days as per the lunar calendar) as shown below, they are called `dagdhayogas'. The name is perhaps derived from the reason that ventures started on such days of the week, united (yoga = union) with certain tithis, become dagdha or destroyed (dagdha = burnt, destroyed).</p>
		<p>They are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sunday associated with dvādaśi (12th day)</li>
			<li>Monday associated with ekādaśi (11th day)</li>
			<li>Tuesday associated with daśamī (10th day)</li>
			<li>Wednesday associated with tṛtīyā (3rd day)</li>
			<li>Thursday associated with ṣaṣṭhī (6th day)</li>
			<li>Friday associated with dvitīya (2nd day)</li>
			<li>Saturday associated with saptamī (7th day)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The days (or tithis) given in the last column are calculated either from the day after the new-moon or the full-moon.</p>
		<p>These dagdhayoga days are inauspicious.</p>

		<p>The Hindu mythological lore is replete with the stories of constant wars and conflicts between the suras and the asuras, the devas and the dānavas.</p>
		<p>The sage Kaśyapa has been projected by these stories as the progenitor of all living beings. He had thirteen wives, all of whom were daughters of Dakṣaprajāpati. Among these, Aditi, Diti and Danu were more well-known.</p>
		<p>The sons of Aditi are ādityas or āditeyas (same as devas or suras or gods), of Diti, the daityas and of Danu, the dānavas. Sometimes the asuras, the daityas and the dānavas (as also the rākṣasas) are bracketed together. They seem to be the archetypes of violent, greedy and sinful beings.

	<div class="mng">
		<p>Throughout the history of mankind, some kind of belief in destiny, in the unseen hand of fate, seems to have existed. The Hindus have been no exception to this phenomenon.</p>
		<p>The word 'daiva' has been derived  from 'deva', a god or a superior being or a supernatural power. In effect, it means the unseen power of fate (adṛṣṭa).</p>
		<p>The dharmaśāstras and the purāṇas have discussed in detail, the question whether daiva is more powerful or puruṣakāra (human effort). Three different views have emerged:</p> 
		<ol class="arabic">
			<li>Daiva is all-powerful;</li>
			<li>Human effort is superior;</li>
			<li>Both have an equal place in our life.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Since daiva (fate or luck) is generally interpreted as the cumulative effect of our past karmas tending to give a particular direction in this life, the third view seems to be more reasonable.</p>

		<p>Śiva, the third deity of the Hindu Trinity, is always worshipped as a liṅga, a cylindrical symbol with a spherical top. The word 'liṅga' means that Supreme Power into which the whole universe dissolves at the end of creation ('līyate asmin iti liṅgaẖ).').</p>
		<p>A liṅga can be cala (movable) or acala (immovable). The liṅgas in Śiva temples are always acala. Such acala-liṅgas can be of several varieties&#8212;4 or 6 or even 9&#8212;of which the daivata-liṅga (also called 'daivika-liṅga') is one. Since it is supposed to have been established by the gods of heaven it gets this name (daiva = related to gods).</p>
		<p>Its shape resembles that of a flame of light and suggests to our mind hands folded in supplication. Its surface is rugged and contains marks of ṭaṅka (hammer) and śūla (spear). There is no brahmasūtra mark.</p>

		<p>Vivāha or marriage has been a very ancient institution right from the times of the <i>Ṛgveda</i>. The mantras used in the marriage ceremonies of the dvijas ('the twice-born,' the brāhmaṇas, the kṣattriyas and the vaiśyas) even in the modern days draw heavily from the Vedic and allied literature.</p>
		<p>Of the eight forms of marriage depicted in the ancient works like the Gṛhyasūtras, the daiva-vivāha is also one and is classed among the superior varieties. It is described as gifting one's daughter, after properly decorating her, to a priest who has officiated in the sacrifice. It was almost like dakṣiṇā or sacrificial fee.</p>
		<p>It was called 'daiva' since the sacrifice was for appeasing the devas or gods like Indra and the gifting of the girl took place as a part of the sacrifice.</p>

		<p>The <i>Bhagavadgītā</i> is a cardinal scripture of Hinduism revered by all sections of the Hindus. It has also attracted the attention of many a spiritual seeker and savant from the great religions of the world.</p>
		<p>The sixteenth chapter of this work deals with two archetypes among the human beings&#8212;the āsuric or the demoniac and the daivī or the divine beings. The former are hostile to all moral and spiritual values whereas the latter are fully receptive to them.</p>
		<p>These moral and spiritual values listed in this chapter (16.1-3) are called 'daivīsampad' or 'daivīsampat', a wealth (sampat = wealth) that ultimately leads to the attainment of the divine state (daivī = divine).</p>
		<p>They are: abhaya (fearlessness), sattvasaṁśuddhi (purity of the heart), jñāna-yoga-vyavasthiti (steadfastness in knowledge and devotion), dāna (benevolence), dama (control of senses), yajña (worship), svādhyāya (study of the scriptures), tapas (austerity of body, speech and mind), ārjava (uprightness), ahiṁsā (non-violence), satya (truth), akrodha (freedom from anger), tyāga (renunciation), śānti (tranquillity), apaiśuna (aversion to slander), bhūteṣu dayā (compassion towards all living beings), aloluptva (freedom from sensuality), mārdava (gentleness), hrī (modesty), acāpala (steadiness), tejas (vigour), kṣamā (forgiveness), dhṛti (fortitude), śauca (purity), adroha (harmlessness), nātimānitā (freedom from vanity).</p>

They can also be benevolent spirits and guide the devotees, along the right path.</p>
		<p>These ḍākinīs are supposed to have burst forth from the derisive laughter of Śivadūtī (an aspect of Durgā) and fought with the rākṣasas or the demons in the armies of the demon king Ruru.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>A prajāpati or Father of beings, Dakṣa is a familiar figure often mentioned in the Hindu mythological literature. There appear to be two Dakṣas, belonging to two different periods known as manvantaras. (See <span class="wordref">MANVANTARA</span>.)</p>
		<p>The first belonged to the Svāyambhuva-manvantara and had married Prasūti, the daughter of the Manu Svayambhū. Out of the 24 daughters he begot in her, Satī was one who had been married to Śiva.</p>
		<p>Once a misunderstanding developed between Dakṣa and Śiva due to the apparent disrespect shown by the latter. When Dakṣa performed a big yajña or sacrifice, he ignored Śiva completely and did not invite him. However, Satī, due to her filial love towards her father Dakṣa, went to attend the same much against her husband Śiva's warning. Being incensed by the callous behaviour of her father she gave up her body in the hall of sacrifice itself in yoga. Enraged by this tragedy, Śiva got Dakṣa's sacrifice desecrated and destroyed through Vīrabhadra, a terrific emanation from himself. Dakṣa too was beheaded but was restored to life by the all-merciful Śiva at the importunate pleadings of the gods. Dakṣa's regrets and apology once again restored the good relationship between them.</p>
		<p>The second Dakṣa (of the Cākṣuṣa-manvantara) was commanded by Brahmā (creator) to proceed with the creation of living beings. He did so using his psychic powers. Devas (Gods), ṛṣis (sages), gandharvas ( a type of semi-divine beings), asuras (demons), sarpas (serpents) apart from human beings were all created by him.</p> 
		<p>Dakṣa is also the name of an ancient author of a smṛti (a secondary scripture, a law-book) which is generally called <i>Dakṣasmṛti</i>. The extant work has seven chapters and 220 verses. The topics dealt with are varied. Apart from Varṇāśrama-dharmas, the subjects include the giving of gifts, eulogy of a good housewife, aśauca or ceremonial impurity to be observed on birth or death in one's family, certain aspects of yoga and the philosopJty of advaita.</p>

		<p>Out of the several forms of Śiva described in the purāṇas and the āgamas, the DakṣiṇāmUrti is also one.</p>
		<p>It is a benign aspect of his. Since he was facing south (dakṣiṇa = south) at the time of teaching the sages in a secluded spot in the Himālayas, he came to be known as Dakṣiṇāmūrti. Sometimes the word 'dakṣiṇā' is interpreted as jñāna, knowledge or wisdom, in which case he represents the very personification of knowledge and wisdom.</p>
		<p>FIGURE</p>
		<p>He is shown with three eyes, four arms and two legs and is seated under banyan tree. Two of the hands (the front right and the front left) are showing jñānamudrā and varadamudrā, postures of imparting knowledge and giving gifts respectively.

One of the legs is trampling upon the apasmārapuruṣa (cretinous person) signifying ignorance.</p>
		<p>The tāntrik works describe him as white in complexion.</p>
		<p>He may be shown as surrounded by several ṛṣis or sages eager to learn spiritual wisdom from him.</p>

		<span class="word">Dakṣiṇāmūrti Upaniṣad</span> <span class="word_def"></span>
	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>This is a short Upaniṣad of 33 verses, assigned to the <i>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</i>, but classed among the minor ones. It deals mainly with the meditation on Dakṣiṇāmūrti, an aspect of Śiva representing a teacher of divine wisdom.</p>
		<p>Once, a group of sages under the leadership of Śaunaka, approached the deathless sage Mārkaṇḍeya with due respect and asked him how he had attained the cirajīvatva or the deathless state as also eternal bliss. He replied, 'By the esoteric knowledge of the principle of Śiva.'</p>
		<p>Then they put him nine questions:</p>
		<p>What is that esoteric knowledge of the principle of Śiva? Who is the deity in it? Which are the mantras (spiritual formulae)? What is the steadfast devotion needed? What is the means of attaining that knowledge? What is its instrument? What is the offering? What is its final state? What is the final abode?</p>
		<p>The esoteric knowledge of Śiva is the realisation of him in his aspect as Dakṣiṇāmūrti. Śiva is called Dakṣiṇāmūrti since he can silently give the gift (= dakṣiṇā) of Self-knowledge to anyone that is seen by him.</p>
		<p>He himself is the deity (= deva) since he shines (deva = one who shines) in his own glory and joy at the time of dissolution of the world.</p>
		<p>As regards the mantras, the Upaniṣad offers five of them:</p>
		<ol class="arabic">
			<li><i>Oṁ nama bhagavate dakṣiṇāmūrtaye mahyam medhām prajñām prayaccha svāhā ||</i></li>
			<li><i>Oṁ dakṣiṇāmūrtir-atarom</i> ||</li>
			<li><i>Oṁ blūṁ namo hrīṁ aiṁ dakṣiṇāmūrtaye jñānaṁ dehi svāhā</i> ||</li>
			<li><i>Oṁ hrīṁ śrīṁ sāmbaśivāya tubhyaṁ svāhā</i> ||</li>
			<li><i>(Oṁ) namo bhagavate tubhyaṁ</i><br>
				<i>vaṭamūlanivāsine</i> |<br>
				<i>vāgīśāya mahājñāna-</i><br>
				<i>dāyine māyine namaḥ</i> ||
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The steadfast devotion needed is the conviction that one is Brahman, which should last till the death of the body.</p>
		<p>The means of attaining that knowledge is the repetition of the mantra (one of the five already given) with the conscious thinking that one is identical with the deity denoted by the mantra.</p>
		<p>The instrument is singular devotion to the mantra.</p>
		<p>Offering is the offering of the movement of one's limbs as worship to the deity of the mantra.</p>
		<p>The final state is the attainment of the perfect equanimity of the three guṇas.</p>
		<p>And, the final abode is the heart or the sahasrāra (thousand-petalled lotus in the crown of the head) which are the places for the realisation of the Self.</p>
		<p>The Upaniṣad ends with the eulogy that one who learns this esoteric wisdom is freed from all sins and attains liberation from transmigration.</p>

		<p>Dakṣiṇāpatha is that region which is south of the river Narmadā. Its extent is about one-fourth of Bāratavarṣa. Some of the people inhabiting this region are: Pāṇḍyas, Keraḷas, Coḷas, Setukas, Mūṣikas, Kumāras, Māhiṣakas, Kāveras, Vidarbhas, Daṇḍakas, Āndhras, Ṛṣikas, Kuntalas and so on.</p>
		<p>The modern Deccan region is almost the same as Dakṣiṇāpatha.</p>

		<p>Visiting a famous place of pilgrimage at least once in a life-time has been a great ambition cherished by all devout Hindus. And, such places of pilgrimage are legion in Hinduism. Many of these pilgrim centres have acquired their importance due to their intimate association with great saints and religious leaders.</p>
		<p>One such place, of a rather recent origin, is Dakṣiṇeśvara, now a part of the city of Calcutta. Due to its close connection with the life of Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa (A. D. 1836-1886) it is now attracting thousands of votaries and visitors throughout the year.</p>
		<p>As one enters the temple complex from the riverside through the landing ghāt on the eastern bank of the Ganges river, one comes to the main portico called 'Cāndni'. On either side of it are the Śiva temples six to the north and six to the south. They are all identical. One has to cross the open courtyard to reach the temple of Kālī, the main shrine.</p>
		<p>Built by Rāṇī Rāsamaṇi (A. D. 1793-1861), a rich landlady, in 1855, this temple of Kālī is the central attraction of this place. The goddess is known as 'Bhavatāriṇī', 'redeemer from the sufferings of the world'. The image has been carved out of a single piece of basalt and faces south. The deity is standing on the chest of Śiva (her spouse) who lies prostrate on a thousand-petalled silver lotus. The height of the image is 85 cms. (33.5 inches) and the shrine-room is 4.5 metres (15 ft.) square excluding the raised plinth and the overall height is more than 33 metres (100 ft.).</p>
		<p>Open on all sides and facing the main shrine is the Nāṭmandir (literally, 'dance-hall') measuring 22.5 metres (75 ft.) by 15 metres (50 ft.). It is meant for meditation and religio-cultural activities like devotional music, dramas and dances with religious themes.</p>
		<p>Behind the temple of Kālī stands another temple dedicated to Kṛṣṇa in his Rādhākānta aspect. The images of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā are 55 cms. (21.5 inches) and 40 cms. (16 inches) respectively.</p>
		<p>Other holy spots in the campus are: Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa's room, Nahabat and Bakultala ghāṭ, the Pañcavaṭī and the Bel tree as also the small cottage or meditation hut.</p>
		<p>Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa spent nearly thirty years of his life in that room. The room is about 7 metres (24 ft.) square. The two wooden cots&#8212;one smaller than the other&#8212;which he was using have been preserved. The room opens on to a semicircular verandah to the west which faces the Ganges river.</p>
		<p>The Nahabat or music tower is to the north of Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa's room and has an octagonal room on the ground-floor measuring 2.3 metres (7.75 ft.) across. The entrance door is hardly 1.2 metres (4 ft.) in height. Śrī Śāradā Devī (better known as the Holy Mother) lived in this room. Candrādevī, mother of Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa, lived on the first floor.</p>
		<p>The Bakultala-ghāṭ is the bathing ghāṭ (close to the Nahabat) of the Ganges river, which Śrī Śāradā Devī used to use.</p>
		<p>The Pañcavaṭī is a grove of five sacred trees intended as a place for spiritual practices. It was renovated by Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa himself.</p>
		<p>The Bel tree which is a little away from the Pañcavaṭī is the very tree under which Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa practised severe tāntric disciplines guided by Bhairavī Brāhmaṇī.</p>
		<p>The small cottage ie the very meditation room where the great saint attained Advaitic samādhi under the guidance of the monk Totāpurī.</p>

		<p>All the Hindu philosophical systems which accept the authority of the Vedas, posit mokṣa or liberation from transmigratory existence, as the final goal of life. This becomes possible only when one realises one's real nature as the ātman, the Self, of the nature of pure consciousness, totally different from the body-mind complex. This, again, involves a lot of spiritual struggle wherein one has to conquer the pulls and pushes of the powerful sense-organs and sense-objects. 'Dama' is the technical term given to this aspect of spiritual discipline, by the Vedāntic treatises, especially the Upaniṣads and the <i>Bhagavadgītā</i>.</p>
		<p>It is generally defined as restraining and pulling back the external sense-organs like the eyes and the ears from all those objects which do not aid the meditation on the ātman, but try to distract and disturb the mind.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>Pictures and images of Śiva (one of the major forms of God in Hinduism) show him as holding the triśūla (trident) and the ḍamaru (a small drum) in his hands.</p>
		<p>The ḍamaru which is a folk or tribal musical instrument of the percussion type, is in extensive use even now in the rural parts of India, especially by the folk-dancers and priests of the tāntrik tradition. It is a sort of kettle-drum, very small in size. It is made of two inverted bowls of wood or clay, the open ends being covered with parchment or thin leather. Strings with beads at their ends are attached to the slender middle portion. When the drum is rhythmically shaken by hand, a pleasant rattling sound is produced, as the beads strike the membrane on the open ends.</p>
		<p>In the images of Śiva (especially the dancing ones like Naṭarāja) the ḍamaru is held in the upper right hand.</p>
		<p>According to some mythological accounts, Śiva, at the request of the gods in heaven, is said to have danced with power and grace&#8212;a rare combination indeed&#8212;using the ḍamaru and sounding it fourteen times. Each time, the sound that emerged, formed a specific pattern, giving rise to the fourteen basic aphorisms of Sanskrit grammar (called <i>Māheśvarasūtras</i>, like 'a-i-uṇ,' 'ṛ-lṛk' and so on). Consequently the symbolical meaning of the ḍamaru in Śiva's hand is sound or alphabets or grammar or language. It may also represent the ākāśa or the ether principle, the first of the five basic elements in the process of creation of the world.</p>
