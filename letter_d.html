	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>Derived from the root `dhā' (to support, to sustain) the word `dadhi' represents curds (curdled milk or yoghurt), since, perhaps, it is considered to be a better food item than milk in sustaining the health of the body.</p>
		<p>It has important uses in Vedic sacrifices. It is used to curdle fresh, hot, milk which is used as oblation and also consumed by the sacrificer in the Darśa sacrifice. So also in the Āgrayaṇa rite. In the animal sacrifice (Paśubandha) it is utilised to prepare pṛṣadājya (a mixture of curds and ghee) used for sprinkling over the immolated animal. It is expected to be consumed by the sacrificer in the dīkṣā rite (consecration of the sacrificer in a Soma sacrifice).</p>
		<p>`Dadhigraha' refers to the drawing of curds offered to Prajāpati just before the morning pressing of the soma juice.</p>
		<p>`Dadhigharma' is a beverage of hot milk and curdled milk poured into a warm pot by the adhvaryu priest and used as a libation at the midday pressing of the soma juice in a Somayāga. `Dadhimantha' is a beverage of grains (saktu) mixed with curds, also used in sacrifices.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>Dadhīci (also spelt as `Dadhīca') was a great sage who willingly sacrificed his life to help the gods conquer their eternal foes, the asuras.</p>
		<p>Once the gods deposited their various weapons with the sage Dadhīci for safe custody. But they did not return in the stipulated time. Since the weapons were getting rusted and were crumbling, the sage dissolved them in water and drank the same. They got merged in his backbone making it immensely strong. When the gods, under the leadership of their king Indra came back and asked for the return of their weapons, Dadhīci told them what he had done. Since they requested for his backbone, out of which a great weapon could be made and with shich their formidable foe, Vṛtrāsura, could be killed, he immediately obliged them by giving up his body in yoga. Indra's Vajrāyudha (thunderbolt) was prepared out of it.</p>
		<p>Dadhīci stands for the highest ideal of self-sacrifice for social good.</p>
		<p>He was the son of Atharvaṇa and Śānti. The well-known sage Pippalāda of Upaniṣadic fame was his son.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>The political and social turmoil in medieval India was also responsible&#8212;though in a strange and inscrutable way&#8212;to throw up many a great saint who tried by their lives and teachings, to show that the true spirit of religion lies in inner mystical experience and not in dry rituals or meaningless formalities.</p>
		<p>Dādū (A. D. 1544-1603) was one of the brighter stars of this period and the most famous of the followers of Kabīr's (A. D. 1440-1518) ideals. Born in Ahmedabad (in Gujarat) he seems to have spent most of his time in Rajasthan. He passed away in the village Narāṇā (or Nārāyaṇa) of Rajasthan, where his followers&#8212;known as `Dādūpanthis'&#8212;have their chief centre even now.</p>
		<p>He established the `Brahma or Parabrahma Sampradāya' with a view to uniting all the divergent faiths in one bond of love and friendship.</p>
		<p>He did not believe in the authority of the scriptures but in the value of realisation. He laid great stress on the cultivation of virtues like humility, compassion, fearlessness, forgiveness and firmness in one's path.</p>
		<p>He was a householder and believed that the natural life of the householder was best suited for spiritual realisation.</p>
		<p>His children too (two sons and two daughters) were persons of high spiritual calibre.</p>
		<p>At his request, his disciples made (in A. D. 1600) a collection of the devotional writings of all the different sects. This anthology, containing the sayings of many Muslim saints also, helped the spiritual aspirants of all types in their journey towards perfection.</p>

		<span class="word">dagdhayoga</span> <span class="word_def"></span>
	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>Right from the Vedic days Hindus have been rather fastidious in choosing `good' days and avoiding `bad' days for the starting of any venture. Even now, even the average Hindu, is very particular about this.</p>
		<p>Such days are generally decided with the help of astrologers and priests who consult the pañcāṅga (the almanac) and give their opinion. One of the inauspicious days mentioned there, is called `dagdhayoga'. If the week days from Sunday to Saturday occur on certain tithis (days as per the lunar calendar) as shown below, they are called `dagdhayogas'. The name is perhaps derived from the reason that ventures started on such days of the week, united (yoga = union) with certain tithis, become dagdha or destroyed (dagdha = burnt, destroyed).</p>
		<p>They are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sunday associated with dvādaśi (12th day)</li>
			<li>Monday associated with ekādaśi (11th day)</li>
			<li>Tuesday associated with daśamī (10th day)</li>
			<li>Wednesday associated with tṛtīyā (3rd day)</li>
			<li>Thursday associated with ṣaṣṭhī (6th day)</li>
			<li>Friday associated with dvitīya (2nd day)</li>
			<li>Saturday associated with saptamī (7th day)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The days (or tithis) given in the last column are calculated either from the day after the new-moon or the full-moon.</p>
		<p>These dagdhayoga days are inauspicious.</p>

		<span class="word">daityas</span> <span class="word_def">('sons of Diti')</span>
	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>The Hindu mythological lore is replete with the stories of constant wars and conflicts between the suras and the asuras, the devas and the dānavas.</p>
		<p>The sage Kaśyapa has been projected by these stories as the progenitor of all living beings. He had thirteen wives, all of whom were daughters of Dakṣaprajāpati. Among these, Aditi, Diti and Danu were more well-known.</p>
		<p>The sons of Aditi are ādityas or āditeyas (same as devas or suras or gods), of Diti, the daityas and of Danu, the dānavas. Sometimes the asuras, the daityas and the dānavas (as also the rākṣasas) are bracketed together. They seem to be the archetypes of violent, greedy and sinful beings. However, even from among them great persons like Prahlāda, Bali and Bāṇa had been born and their lives as men of virtue and devotees of God had been exemplary.</p>
