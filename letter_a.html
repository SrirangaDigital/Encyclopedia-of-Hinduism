		<p>Being the first manifest sound that emerged out of the ḍamaru (miniature drum) of Lord Śiva during his famous dance (tāṇḍavanṛtya), it is the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet and the fundamental sound without which no other letter can be pronounced. Hence it is identified with God himself or used as his symbol. The Sanskrit lexicons give as many as 31 meanings and it is used in six different ways in grammar.</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>In Indian philosophical systems, the word bādha and its derivatives are often used as technical terms, in the sense of objection or contradiction. Hence `abādhita' means that which is not contradicted, `a' representing the negative particle. For instance, truth or reality is defined as that which is abādhita, never contradicted. Obviously what is contradicted can never be considered true or real in the ultimate sense.</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>Lyrical poems, the compositions of the mystics of Maharashtra, are popularly known as `abhaṅgas.' `Abhaṅga' literally means `unbroken or indivisible.' The story goes that when Sant Tukārām, one of the greatest saints of Maharashtra, was compelled by his detractors to consign his poetical works to the river Indrāyaṇī, Lord Viṭṭhala (Viṣṇu) restored them to their author saying that the works were `abhaṅga' (`indestructible'). That apart, it is true that these poems and songs abound in philosophical, mystical and ethical teachings which are `abhaṅga' and hence true for all time. Besides Tukārām, several other saints like Jñāneśvar, Nāmdev, Eknāth and Rāmdās, including women saints like Janābāi and Kānhopātrā have composed these abhaṅgas. Importance of the divine name and its repetition in spiritual life, God-realisation as the <i>summum bonum</i> of life, the necessity of acquiring guru's grace, the harmony of worldly life and spiritual life, the need for inculcating moral values in day-to-day life are some of the oft-recurring themes of these compositions. If making the abstract spiritual truths intelligible and practicable to the common masses is the measure of success of religious reform movements, the Bhakti Movement of the saints of Maharashtra through their abhaṅgas has succeeded admirably. Even today these abhaṅgas are sung by the common folk.</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>Literally the word means a `reflection,' an `appearance,' hence, a false phenomenon which shows itself as the real. For instance, the reflection of an object in a mirror is an `ābhāsa.' The word is widely used in Advaita Vedānta in the context of the relationship between the jīva (individual self) and Brahman (the Supreme Self). The jīva according to one of the schools of Advaita Vedānta in the context of the relationship between the jīva (individual self) and Brahman (the Supreme Self). The jīva according to one of the schools of Advaita Vedāta, is only an `ābhāsa' of Brahman in and through the medium of the antaḥkaraṇa (mind).</p>
		<p>In Hindu logic, the word is used with regard to hetu or cause. Owing to several factors, a real hetu can get obscured and a false hetu, hetvābhāsa, can appear in its place leading to wrong conclusions. For more details see HETVĀBHĀSA.</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>The production of an effect is the sign of the existence of the cause. In the same way, the non-production of it is the sign of its non-existence. This is the line of argument adopted by the Vaiśeṣika system, one of the two dialectical schools of Hindu philosophy. According to it, the non-perception of a jar in the ground before us is the same as the perception of the non-existence, abhāva, of the jar. This is the only system which considers abhāva as a fundamental category of reality and describes four kinds of it: 1) prāgabhāva-non-existence before coming into being, as for e.g., the non-existence of the jar before it is produced; 2) pradhvaṁsābhāva-non-existence after destruction, as for e.g., the non-existence of the jar after it is destroyed; 3) anyonyābhāva-mutual non-existence of two different objects, as for e.g., the non-existence of the cow in the horse and <i>vice versa</i>; and 4) atyantābhāva-absolute non-existence, as for e.g., the non-existence of colour in air.</p>

		<p>In the eternal quest for happiness, peace and pleasure, man is often compelled to counteract the various forces and powers that thwart this quest. When common or natural remedies available to him fail to bring the desired result, he naturally turns towards uncommon and supernatural remedies. Attempts at enlisting the help of the supernatural, be it a fierce deity, a ghost or a disembodied spirit, are a common feature of all cultures. Hinduism seems to be no exception to this. The rites of abhicāra, though occasionally mentioned in the <i>Ṛgveda,</i> are found in abundance in the last of the Vedas, the <i>Atharvaveda</i> as also the subsidiary works based on it like the <i>Āṅgirasa Kalpasūtras</i> and the <i>Kauśika Kalpasūtras.</i> These rites pertain to a wide variety of subjects ranging from curing serious ailments, inflicting injury on enemies and rivals, winning the love of the beloved, to securing long life and prosperity. For instance, if a woman ties a particular root on her body with appropriate mantras, the mind of her husband is attracted only towards her and not towards her co-wives. A person harassed by enemies can perform certain rites by which spirits called kṛtyās will come to his help in overcoming them. Persons suffering from incurable diseases are advised to wear certain amulets like mūlamaṇi, duly consecrated.</p>

Emaciated body, dark complexion, dark clothes and a shrunken countenance with the eyes turned upwards characterise such images. They are, as a rule, established in the outermost periphery of the village or town, known as the `paiśācapada' (the place where goblins live), in inaccessible places like mountain tops or thick jungles.

		<span class="word">abhihitānvaya-vāda</span> <span class="word_def">(`theory of words in relation')</span>
	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>The darśanas or Indian philosophical systems were very particular in working out their own theories about the meanings of words and sentences, because, upon these depended the development of their arguments to establish their schools <i>vis-a-vis</i> other schools.</p>
		<p>A word may hve a direct meaning as also an implied meaning. When such words are put together to form a sentence, the total effect may be something more than the meanings indicated by the individual words. Different schools differ as regards the details.</p>
		<p>The above theory is propounded by the Nyāya school and accepted by Kumārila Bhaṭṭa (7th cent. A. D.) of the Mīmāṁsā school. According to this, the words forming a sentence, can have independent meanings also in addition to contributing to the total sense of the sentence. For instance, in the sentence `gām ānaya,' `Bring the cow', the word `gām' is a noun in the accusative case and refers to a cow, an animal of the bovine class. The word `ānaya' is a verb in the imperative mood denoting the action of bringing. When related in a sentence thus, they give the total meaning that the person to whom they are addressed, is expected to bring the animal cow. However they do not lose their individual significance. The words when used independently continue to denote the animal cow and the act of bringing.</p>
		<p>This theory is not acceptable to Prabhākara Bhaṭṭa (a disciple of Kumārila), another teacher of Mīmāṁsā, forming a parallel school. According to him, words have no independent denotation and can denote something only when used in injunctive sentences (`vidhi') in relation to other words. His theory is known as `anvitābhidhāna-vāda.'</p>

During the Mahābhārata war, in the absence of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, Abhimanyu was obliged to break through the cakravyūha, the wheel-formation of the Kaurava army. Though he fought valiantly, he was surrounded by a multitude of Kaurava warriors and killed as he was ignorant of the technique of extricating himself out of that cakravyūha.</p>

He lived in Kashmir. His literary activities extended from about A. D. 980 to A. D. 1020. He was an authority on several subjects and at least forty works are attributed to him.</p>

		<p>All living beings, starting from an insignificant worm right up to the highly evolved man, have a natural fear of death and a strong desire to live. According to the Yoga system of Patañjali, though this is understandable, it is not desirable! It is not desirable because it is born out of avidyā or ignorance of the true nature of the soul which is really immortal. This very ignorance is a great stumbling block on the path to perfection. Hence abhiniveśa which is technically termed as a kleśa, an affliction or a vicious tendency, preventing the rise of true knowledge, must be cast off by the seeker of perfection.

While recognising this, they also stressed the need to confine them within limits through dharma (righteousness), and instituted the system of yajña or sacrifice through which man could achieve the desired ends. Abhiplava is one of the sacrifices included under the Soma group of sacrifices and forms part of a bigger one called Gavāmayana. It is spread over six days and includes four ukthyas (a small Soma sacrifice) and two Agniṣṭomas (another Soma sacrifice with hymns of praise on Agni, the fire-god) and the singing of some Sāma hymns.</p>

		<p>Caste has always been a dominant feature in the Hindu society. Division into groups based on vocation is a phenomenon common to all societies. But in India, such groups have often become fossilized and mutually exclusive, the membership of the group being acquired only by birth. Hence the appellation `jāti' (= birth). In spite of the vigorous attempts of its leaders to make the particular jāti a water-tight compartment, thanks to human nature, mixing has always taken place throughout history, giving rise to more castes, born out of the admixture of the prevalent ones. The ābhīras constitute such a mixed caste. They are regarded by Manu as the offspring of a brāhmaṇa by an aṁbaṣṭha (descended from a brāhmaṇa father and vaiśya mother) woman. Whether the ābhīras were a nomadic tribe which migrated into India by stages or were natives of this land, it is certain they lived a nomadic and predatory life. By the 2nd cent. A. D. some of them had attained high ranks and had even siezed political power, wielding it effectively till the 4th cent. A. D. Mention may be made of Ābhīra Īśvarasena, son of Sivadatta, supposed to be the founder of the Kalacuri-Cedi era (3rd cent. A. D.) who rose to the royal rank in northern Maharashtra.</p>
		<p>The common people among them lived by dairy farming. They have contributed much to the development of Indian music. The Apabhraṁśa dialect, a form of Prākṛt, is also their contribution. But their greatest contribution is towards the growth of pastoral legends centring round Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The modern āhīrs are considered to be the descendants of ābhīras and are scattered over the greater part of India.</p>

		<p>This is a technical term used in Vedic liturgy to indicate the extracting of the soma juice from the soma stalks, by pressing them. There are two kinds of pressing: kṣullakābhiṣava (the little pressing) and mahābhiṣava (the great pressing). In the kṣullakābhiṣava, the Adhvaryu (one of the principal priests who does most of the ritual acts and recites the mantras from the <i>Yajurveda</i>) places a few soma stalks on one of the lower grinding stones (called upara), pours consecrated water (called nigrābhya) and beats the stalks in three turns consisting respectively of 8, 11 and 12 single beatings. The juice extracted is collected in a cup. In the mahābhiṣava, four priests sitting round the hide that holds the pressing stones (called adhiṣavaṇacarman) beat the stalks in three turns, after sprinkling them with consecrated water, using the crushing stones (called grāvan) for the operation. The whole act is a ceremonial ritual, forming part of Soma sacrifices.</p>

The Abhiṣecanīya rite which comes under the Soma group of sacrifices, is spread over five days, consisting of one dīkṣā (taking the vows), three upasad (a group of rites in which ghee is offered to Agni), and one sutyā (pressing of the soma stalks) days. The Dīkṣā lasts for a year.

		<p>Performance of religious and semi-religious rites to propitiate one's ancestors is part and parcel of many cultures in the world. The Hindus do it through śrāddha (death anniversary rites of departed ancestors), though its forms may vary from caste to caste. Inviting and feeding the brāhmaṇas of learning and character is not only obligatory but also considered highly meritorious since the spirits of the departed souls are believed to be satisfied with it. When these brāhmaṇas are par-taking of the food, the performer of the śrāddha or his representative is expected to stand respectfully in front of them (abhi) and chant certain Vedic and paurāṇic hymns prescribed as suitable for such occasions, in their hearing (śravaṇa). The idea is that this helps in creating a spiritual atmosphere soaked in which the brāhmaṇas eat the food and consequently the forefathers will fell immensely satisfied and happy.</p>
		<p>Some of the hymns recommended by the dharmaśāstras to be chanted during abhiśravaṇa are:</p>
		<p>Gāyatrī (<i>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</i> 3.62.10), Rakṣoghna Mantras (<i>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</i> 4.4.1-5), Pitrya Mantras (<i>Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa</i> 2.6.12.3), Apratiratha Mantras (<i>Taittirīya Saṁhitā</i> 4.6.4.1), <i>Puruṣasūkta</i> (<i>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</i> 10.90.1), <i>Śrīsūkta</i> (<i>Ṛgveda-khila</i>), <i>Pavamānasūkta</i> (<i>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</i> 9.1.1), Trisuparṇa Mantras (<i>Mahānārāyaṇopaniṣad</i> 38 to 40).</p>
		<p>While chanting the hymns, the sacred thread should be worn in the upavīta fashion (hanging from the left shoulder to below the right arm-pit). The chanting should be neither too loud nor too fast.</p>

		<p>Honouring one's superiors is a basic dogma in Hindu religion and culture. As long as it was scrupulously followed, it contributed to the solidarity of the society. In the presence of a person worthy of honour, one is expected to rise from one's seat and salute him. The former is called pratyut-thāna and the latter abhivādana. After facing (= abhi) him, introducing himself and bowing down to him, the superior is expected to pronounce benediction (vādana). Hence the term. While offering abhivādana, it is necessary to repeat one's gotra (parental lineage) along with the name of the particular branch of the Veda traditionally studied in the family, and one's own name. During this repetition he should touch his ears and bend his head down. After this he can bow down touching or not touching the feet of the superior. In upasaṅgrahaṇa, another variety of abhivādana, clasping the feet of the superior at the time of saluting is obligatory.</p>
		<p>Elaborate details have been given in the dharmaśāstras with regard to abhivādana. For instance, it can be nitya (obligatory every day), naimittika (occasional) or kāmya (done with certain rewards in view). Bowing down to one's teacher and parents everyday comes under the first category. Saluting the elders on special occasions like after returning from a journey, belongs to the second. If done at one's own will, seeking knowledge or long life or bliss in heaven it is classed under the third. Detailed rules have also been given as to whom abhivādana can be offered or should not be offered, the rules being based on caste, learning, status in society and age. It is noteworthy that salutation to women, except to one's mother, should be offered without touching their feet.</p>
		<p>The persons to whom abhivādana is offered should return it in a manner proper to their position and status.</p>

However, the great teachers of yoga assure us that it is not impossible, though difficult. With the right attitude and determined practice, this becomes possible. The path prescribed is abhyāsayoga. This term which seems to be the creation of the <i>Bhagavadgītā</i> (8.8 and 12.9), a highly venerated scripture of Hinduism, has been interpreted in two slightly different but compatible ways: (a) abhyāsa or practice leading to yoga or concentration; (b) abhyāsa or practice which is itself yoga since it leads to yoga or concentration. Withdrawing the mind repeatedly from the various objects towards which it is naturally drawn and fixing it upon the desired goal is abhyāsa. When this fixing becomes steady and grows in intensity, it ripens into yoga or perfect concentration, also called samādhi. Hence abhyāsa and yoga form the preliminary and final stages of the same discipline. Retiring into solitude, choosing the right place conducive to yoga, observing moderation in all aspects of daily life, practising self-control-these are some of the disciplines recommended by the <i>Bhagavadgītā</i> for abhyāsayoga (<i>vide</i> 6.10-28).</p>

		<p>Belief in the continued existence of the forefathers (pitṛs) in a subtle body at a different plane (pitṛloka or the world of manes) is a common feature of mankind in general and the Hindus in particular. It is often believed that these forefathers when propitiated through appropriate rites can bestow on their descendants worldly prosperity, nay, even spiritual benefits. The propitiating rite is called śrāddha, since it is offered with śraddhā (faith). Of the several śrāddhas, ābhyudayika-śrāddha is particularly connected with abhyudaya (worldly well-being and is performed on auspicious occasions like the birth of children, their marriage and so on. It can even be performed at the commencement of a charitable act such as the dedication of a well or tank or park to the public.</p>
		<p>Unlie the other śrāddhas which are solemn, this śrāddha is a joyous occasion. Hence certain changes have been effected in its performance. For instance: It is done in the morning and not in the afternoon. The yajñopavīta (sacred cord) is worn in the usual way and not from right to left. The mantra `svadhā,' which is a must in other śrāddhas is not used. Yava grains (barley) are used as the oblatory material instead of sesamum.</p>
		<p>This śrāddha is sometimes identified with Nāndīśrāddha or Vṛddhiśrāddha.</p>

		<p>Any spot of serenity and natural beauty can be made into either a place of picnic or pilgrimage. The choice depends upon the temperament. To the Hindu mind such spots reflect God's beauty and offer a congenial atmosphere for contemplation upon Him. One of such spots that nature has been bountiful in bestowing upon India is Mount Abu situated in southern Rajasthan and at a distance of 170 kms., (110 miles) from city of Ahmedabad. It is part of the Arāvalī range of mountains. The summit called Guruśikhara rises to a height of 1700 metres (5610 ft.) above the mean sea level. Referred to as Arbuda in the <i>Mahābhārata,</i> it is extolled as a tīrthakṣetra (a place of pilgrimage) on account of its association with the great sage Vasiṣṭha whose āśrama or hermitage was situated here. This is also supposed to be the place of origin of the Agnikula-kṣattriyas of Rajasthan like the Cauvhāns, Solaṅkis and Parmārs. Among the Hindu religious sites, the chief one is the Guruśikhara itself, containing in a cavern the `footprints' of an ancient sage. The Acaleśvara temple campus has a cleft in the rock containing `Śiva's toenail.' The same campus contains a shrine for Arbuda Mātā, the consort of Śiva and the Mother-goddess of the hill. There are also shrines for the sages Vasiṣṭha and Gautama at Gomukha. The temples at Devāṅgaṇa are dedicated to Viṣṇu and Narasimha. Mount Abu is also famous for its Jain temples built in marble by the merchant prince Vimalśā (A. D. 1032) and the brothers Tejpāl and Vastupāl (A. D. 1197-1247). These temples are dedicated to Ṛṣabhadeva and Pārśvanātha, the 1st and the 23rd Tīrthaṅkaras.</p>

		<p>Śiva, the third deity of the Hindu Trinity responsible for the dissolution of this universe is worshipped both in the anthropomorphic aspect and as the liṅga. The latter however is the rule, the former being an exception. Etymologically the word `liṅga' stands for that in which everything gets dissolved (<i>līyate asmin iti liṅgaḥ</i>). Liṅga also means an emblem. Hence the Śivaliṅga is an emblem of God Śiva into whom everything gets dissolved at the time of destruction of the created universe. Since God is beyond name and form and since we cannot conceive of an abstract principle like Him without the aid of concrete symbols, a rounded surface is perhaps the nearest approach to him.</p>
		<p>Śivaliṅgas may be cala (movable) or acala (immovable). The acala-liṅgas, also called sthāvara-liṅgas, are the stone liṅgas permanently fixed in the temples. There are several varieties of them classified under four or six or even nine groups. An acalaliṅga has three parts: Brahmabhāga (square in shape), Viṣṇubhāga (octagonal) and Rudrabhāga (round). The first two parts are embedded inside the pedestal, the third part alone being visible. This is the one to which pūjā or worship is offered. Hence it is called the `pūjābhāga.'</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>Rituals are an important aspect of every religion. If philosophy explains the basic truths and mythology expounds the same through stories and analogies, rituals give them a concrete shape and lay down the practical disciplines to be followed which will ultimately lead to the realization of those truths. In Hinduism such rituals are legion. In fact, even the basic acts of our daily routine like cleaning the teeth or bathing have been elevated to the level of a religious ritual. The idea is that our whole life is a yajña (sacrifice) or sādhanā (spiritual practice).</p>
		<p>Practically all the rituals have to be preceded by ācamana or ceremonial sipping of water. A few drops of water, as much as can immerse a grain of blackgram, are taken in the palm of the right hand cupped like a cow's ear (gokarṇa) and sipped from the root of the thumb (called brahmatīrtha). After sipping three times, various parts of the body like the eyes, ears, nose, chest and head are touched with the wet hand in a specified order. Ācamana should always be done in the sitting posture.</p>
		<p>The process of ācamana is believed to cover the prāṇa (basic life-energy, considered as a deity) so that it protects the performer. Even the ancient Upaniṣads like the <i>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</i> (4.1.14) and the <i>Chāndogya</i> (5.2.2) seem to subscribe to this view.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>The smṛtis and dharmaśāstras, the law books that regulate the life of individuals, both at the personal and at the social level, usually deal with three important topics" ācāra (ceremonial duties), vyavahāra (civil and criminal laws) and prāyaścitta (penances and expiatory rites). Of the three, ācāra usually gets the pride of place. Literally, ācāra means conduct. It is often identified with sadācāra, the conduct of good and great men, so much so that dharma (righteousness) itself is said to be born out of ācāra, `ācāraprabhavo dharmaḥ' (<i>Mahābhārata, Anuśāsanaparva</i> 161.172). Whenever one is in doubt with regard to one's duty or action in a particular situation in life, one is advised to seek the guidance of the wise elders of impeccable character. Their words should be implicitly obeyed.</p>
		<p>The ṣaṭkarmas, the six duties included under daily routine, are the most important aspects of ācāra at the personal level. They are: snāna (bath), sandhyā (the sandhyā ritual), japa (repetition of mantra), devapūjā (ritualistic worship of the family deity), homa (sacrifice), Vaiśvadeva (offerings of cooked food to all the gods) and ātithya (honouring the guests). Undergoing the various saṁskāras (purificatory rites) and performing the prescribed duties as per one's varṇa (caste) and āśrama (stage of life) are the other important aspects of ācāra.</p>
		<p>The word ācāra is also used in the sense of `customs and tradition' which is equally important. No doubt the Vedas are the supreme authority in all matters regulating the Hindu society. Since they do not deal with the details of various problems that arise in the day-to-day life and conduct of the individuals, one has to rely upon the smṛtis (recorded collections of great sages) and sadācāra (the conduct of great men). However, in matters of dispute, falling within the jurisdiction of jurisprudence, ācāra as custom and long-standing tradition or usage, is often the decisive factor, provided it is not against the spirit of the Vedas and smṛtis. Such ācāra can be deśācāra (pertaining to the particular region), jātyācāra (pertaining to the particular caste) or kulācāra (pertaining to the particular family). Even the judges or the king had to take cognizance of these ācāras before giving their verdict.</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>In ancient India, education, the panacea for all maladies and problems of life, was imparted more by personal contact than by lectures and discourses. The student learnt more by observing the teacher's life than by hearing his teachings. Hence the teacher had to `be' that, which he wanted to `make' of his student. First `be' and then `make.' It is this philosophy of education that is reflected in this word `ācārya.' It is only he who successfully gathers (ācinoti) the essentials of dharma and wisdom from all sources and practises them (ācarati) in his own life, that deserves the appellation `ācārya.' In a more technical sense, the ācārya is one who performs the upanayana ceremony of the novice and imparts the Vedas to him, along with the accessories known as the Vedāṅgas.</p>
		<p>Great stress was laid on the qualifications which the ācārya had to possess. Birth in a family known for its erudition and piety was always recognised as highly desirable. Deep erudition in the branch of the Veda he was required to teach was expected as a matter of course. A pure and sinless life, serenity and composure, active interest in imparting knowledge were the other qualifications looked for in the ācārya.</p>
		<p>The word is also frequently used as an honorific to men of great erudition and learning, especially if they are the initiators of new schools of thought or the revivers of old ones, like Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja, Madhva and others.</p>
		<p>The term is also applied to an adviser or preceptor guiding sacrificial rites.</p>
		<p>The wife of an ācārya is called `ācāryāṇī' whereas a women receptor is designated `ācāryā.' From this we can infer the existence of women preceptors also.</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>If the solid world we perceive with our senses is a wonderful phenomenon, the unseen Power behind it is a deep mystery. The quest for the mode by which this unseen Power has evolved into this tangible world has resulted in several philosophical schools, often called `darśanas,' in the text-books of Hindu metaphysics. Of these, the Vedānta Darśana of Bādarāyaṇa has attracted the maximum number of commentators one of whom is Nimbārka (11th-12th cent. A. D.). According to him, Brahman, the highest Reality, is a personal God, identified with Kṛṣṇa or Hari. Brahman has two powers cit-śakti (sentient power, i.e., the individual souls) and acit-śakti (non-sentient power, i.e., nature). At the beginning of creation, He manifests these two powers. From acit-śakti or acicchakti, there is a gradual evolution of the entire material world.</p>
		<p>This acicchakti manifests itself in three different forms:</p>
		<ol class="arabic">
			<li>the prākṛta or what is derived from the prakṛti, primal matter, responsible for the material world;</li>
			<li>the aprākṛta, the non-material aspect, the stuff of the celestial bodies and objects as also the regions where the Lord and the freed souls live;</li>

		<span class="word">Acintya-bhedābheda School</span> <span class="word_def"></span>
	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>There have always been two major but parallel currents of thought&#8212;advocating jñāna (knowledge) and bhakti (devotion)-in the Hindu religious tradition, each getting the better of the other at certain periods of history. The school of jñāna or knowledge, based on the Upaniṣads and allied literature like the darśanas has always stressed that mukti (liberation from transmigratory existence) is possible only through ātmajñāna or knowledge of the Self. The school of bhakti or devotion, rooted in the <i>Ṛgveda</i>, but dependent mainly on the epics and the purāṇas (mythological lore) has emphasized that such liberation is possible only through the grace of God, bhakti or devotion to God being the only means of obtaining it. Each of these two schools, being unable to ignore the logical and psychological force of the other, has been obliged to find a place for some of the principles of the rival school though relegating them to an inferior status. More sober thinkers have attempted at reconciling, even harmonising, these two viewpoints with varying success. The best of such attempts which has succeeded remarkably is found in that classic scripture <i>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</i>, which itself is based on an earlier work of a similar kind, <i>Śrī Viṣṇupurāṇa</i>. The philosophical schools of bhakti, based on these two and allied works (e.g., <i>Harivaṁśa</i> and <i>Brahmavaivartapurāṇa</i>) could not disregard the Upaniṣads or the <i>Brahmasūtras</i> (also called <i>Vedāntasūtras</i>, a work systematising the philosophical reflections scattered all over the Upaniṣads) which had attained a very high status among thinkers and religious leaders. Hence they ventured to interpret the <i>Brahmasūtras</i> and the Upaniṣads by superimposing their views&#8212;commonly known as the Bhāgavata school-on them. Though it is difficult to assess the degree of their success, there is no doubt that they have enriched the Hindu philosophical tradition. Among such Bhāgavata schools, those of Nimbārka (11th-12th cent. A.D.), Vallabha and Śrīkṛṣṇa Caitanya or Caitanya (both of the 15th cent. A. D.) have gained recognition and respectability. The religio-philosophical system propounded by Caitanya (A. D. 1485-1533), Jīva Gosvāmī (16th cent. A. D.) and other scholar-mystics of Bengal is known as the Bengal School of Vaiṣṇavism, also designated as the `Acintya-bhedābheda' school. This designation obtains from the fact that the relationship between Brahman (God) on the one hand and prakṛti (nature) and jīva (individual soul) on the other, is `acintya' (incomprehensible) since both `bheda' (difference) and `abheda' (non-difference) can be predicated of it.</p>
		<p>The teachings of this school can be summarised briefly as follows: The ultimate Reality is personal, (Brahman or) Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the God of love and grace. He is the same as the Brahman of the Upaniṣads. He is sat-cit-ānanda (existence-consciousness-bliss-absolute). He is infinite, omnipotent and omnipresent. He is the very embodiment of all blessed qualities that we can every conceive of. In this sense, he is saguṇa (with attributes).</p>
		<p>He has three śaktis or powers: svarūpaśakti, māyā-śakti and jīva-śakti. By his svarūpa-śakti (also called cit-śakti) he upholds his own existence and that of others, knows and makes others know, enjoys and makes others enjoy bliss. These three characteristics of his svarūpa-śakti corresponding to sat, cit and ānanda aspects of his, are called sandhinī, saṁvit and hlādinī śaktis respectively.</p>
		<p>His māyāśakti (also called acit-śakti or jaḍa-śakti), has two aspects: guṇamāyā comprising the three guṇas of sattva, rajas and tamas; jīvamāyā, which makes the jīvas (individual souls) forget their true nature and hence get into the bondage of transmigration. God creates the universe by activating this māyāśakti. The created universe is real but transitory.</p>
		<p>All the living beings from his jīvaśakti (also called taṭasthaśakti).</p>
		<p>Creation proceeds out of him by the exercise of māyāśakti and jīvaśakti. Māyāśakti evolves into the material universe and jīvaśakti involves the jīvas in it. The purpose of creation is to give more opportunities for the jīvas to get mukti by striving for it and by working out their karma.</p>
		<p>God who is the very personification of love and joy, assumes infinite forms including the avatāras or incarnations in this world. Of these, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the chief. His supreme delight is in love, manifested through the Vṛndāvana-līlā. Rādhā, the doyen of the gopīs and the eternal divine consort of Kṛṣṇa is actually the personification of his hlādinīśakti.</p>
		<p>The jīvas who are infinite in number and different from God, are conscious entities atomic in size. They get into the bondage of saṁsāra (transmigration) due to the ignorance of their real nature, brought about by māyā. Mukti is gained by breaking the bondage of karma through bhakti or devotion to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This bhakti can be like that of the servant towards his master (dāsya-bhakti), that of the friend towards his friend (sakhya-bhakti), that of the parents towards their child (vātsalya-bhakti) or that of the beloved towards the lover (kāntā-bhakti or madhura-bhakti).</p>
		<p>For practising the spiritual disciplines leading to bhakti, guidance from a competent guru (spiritual preceptor) is essential. Logic and reasoning are not to be trusted in the path of religion since they can undermine faith. Ethical virtues like compassion, tranquillity and equanimity, humility and freedom from passions should be cultivated. Since all devotees are children of God, caste distinctions should be ignored.</p>
		<p>When bhakti matures into an absolutely pure and selfless state-called kevalā or śuddhā-the devotee aims exclusively at the loving service of Kṛṣṇa as the nearest and dearest one, for his happiness only and does not care even for mukti. This is posited as the fifth puruṣārtha. (See <span class="wordref">PURUṢĀRTHAS</span>.)</p>
		<p>Though four kinds of mukti (See <span class="wordref">MOKṢA</span>) like sālokya are recognised, the śuddha-bhakta is not interested in them.</p>
		<p>All this applies to the jīvas who are bound (baddha). There is another class of jīvas known as nityamuktas (ever-free), who have never been in bondage.</p>
		<p>The word `acintya-bhedābheda' itself needs some explanation. Hindu philosophers are broadly divided into two groups, one holding the view that in the ultimate analysis there is no difference (abheda) between Brahman and the jīva; and the other accepting difference (bheda). The Bengal school of Vaiṣṇavism differs from both and calls itself `acintya-bhedābhedavāda,' since Brahman and jīva are identical (abhinna) in some respects and different (bhinna) in others, the very relationship being beyond our comprehension (acintya). Both being cit (consciousness) are identical in that respect. But Brahman is vibhu-cit (all-pervading consciousness) whereas the jīva is aṇu-cit (atomic consciousness). Again, the jīva is an aṁśa (part) of Brahman who is the aṁśin (the whole). Since the relation between the part and the whole is one of simultaneous bheda and abheda, the same subsists between Brahman and jīva also. How exactly this can be, is beyond human comprehension. Hence the appellation.</p>
		<p>On the side of dogma, this school accords Śrī Caitanya the same status as God since it believes that he is the combined incarnation of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.</p>
		<p>At the social level, the leaders of this school have contributed significantly by removing caste distinctions and encouraging the cultivation of primary moral and social values.</p>

		<span class="word">acit</span> <span class="word_def">(`the insentient')</span>
	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>Man is a `thinking animal.' Once his animal needs are satisfied and he obtains relative peace and stability in life, he starts thinking about the `how,' the `why' and the `when' of things perceived. This thinking about the origin and evolution of things has got to be in the form of conjectures and hypotheses before being advanced as theories. Such conjectures and hypotheses again, can start only from the seen and the known before progressing towards the unseen and the unknown. It is but natural that this world in which man lives, moves and has his being (as it were), is the first to catch his attention. Such attention and thinking often leads to a broad categorisation of the created world. Of such categorisations, what can be more simple, direct and obvious than the twofold one, viz., the living and the non-living, the sentient and the non-sentient? This is exactly what the Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta system&#8212;of which Rāmānuja (A. D. 1017-1137) is the chief exponent&#8212;has done.</p>
		<p>According to this system, the ultimate Reality is threefold: cit (the sentient), acit  (the insentient) and Īśvara (God). The former two are dependent realities, subservient to the latter. (For details see VIŚIṢṬĀDVAITA VEDĀNTA DARŚANA.)</p>
		<p>The acit principle, as its very name indicates, is the matrix of all that is without life and consciousness. Also called prakṛti (nature), it is jaḍa (lifeless and insentient) but capable of vikāra (modification or evolution). It is avidyā (ignorance) since it is opposed to true knowledge and also called māyā since it is the cause of all diverse creations. Being insentient it is incapable of evolving by itself but does so under the controlling will of God.</p>
		<p>According to one classification this acit has three aspects: the śuddha-sattva, the miśra-sattva and sattva-śūnya. The śuddha-sattva aspect has pure sattva guṇa (See GUṆAS.) capable of producing knowledge and bliss, and is the matrix out of which the world Vaikuṇṭha (See VAIKUṆṬHA.) has been made. It is unaffected by the karma of the individual souls and is directly under the control of God. The miśra-sattva aspect has the three guṇas of sattva, rajas and tamas. It is this which evolves as this world, contracts and obstructs the jñāna (knowledge) of the jīvas (individual selves) and sustains their bondage by producing viparīta-jñāna (knowledge opposed to their real nature). Kāla or time forms the third aspect viz., sattva-śūnya.</p>
		<p>Whether kāla should be deemed as an aspect of acit or considered as a special power inhering in God has been a point of debate among the thinkers of the Viśiṣṭādvaita school.</p>

Whether the former, though deserving better recognition, are overshadowed by the latter, or, become known only because of their association with the latter who are head and shoulders above them, is a matter of opinion. Acyuta Prekṣa, who gave saṁnyāsa to Madhvācārya belongs to this group. Not much is known of him. As per the scanty information available in the work <i>Maṇimañjarī</i> of Nārāyaṇācārya (14th cent. A.D.), he was the head of the `Bhaṇḍāra-keri Maṭha.' His preceptor belonged to `Ānandabāla Maṭha' and hailed from Nandigrāma. Since there are several Nandigrāmas in the country, it is difficult to decide which one it was. Acyuta Prekṣa was an advaitin and belonged to the Bhāgavata school. It was he who administered the monastic vows and gave the new names Pūrṇaprajña, Ānandatīrtha and others to  Madhvācārya. He had to accept defeat from his own discipe while teaching him.

	<div class="mng">
		<p>Each of the four Vedas, the basic scriptures of the Hindus, is divided broadly into two sections: the Mantra and the Brāhmaṇa. The Mantra section contains prayers and hymns. The Brāhmaṇa section deals with the application of these mantras in rituals.</p>
		<p>The <i>Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa</i> forms the sixth (and the last) chapter of a bigger work called <i>Ṣaḍviṁśa Brāhmaṇa</i> which itself is the second of the nine Brāhmaṇas of the <i>Sāmaveda</i> available to us now. Though the first five chapters of the <i>Ṣaḍviṁśa Brāhmaṇa</i> deal with the ceremonies and rituals connected with the Somayāgas, the sixth one makes a complete departure and deals with strange phenomena like ill-omens and the expiatory rites that help offset their effects. It is perhaps due to this reason that this particular section is thus designated (adbhuta = wonderful, strange).</p>
		<p>There are indications to prove that the <i>Ṣaḍviṁśa Brāhmaṇa</i> originally consisted of only five chapters and the sixth i.e., the <i>Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa</i> was appended to it later.</p>
		<p>The entire book deals with adbhuta śāntis or appeasement of portents, and is divided into twelve khaṇḍas or sections. The various portents indicating imminent dangers are described as being connected with the gods like Indra, Yama, Varuṇa and Viṣṇu; and appropriate śāntis (rites of appeasement of the deities) are also given. The idea seems to be that when these gods are displeased, troubles start and when appeased through appropriate rites, they cease.</p>
		<p>The list of portents given is quite long but interesting. Starting form the breaking or damage of household articles for apparently no reason, right up to natural calamities like earthquakes, destruction of crops and the fall of meteors, the list mentions the happening of many unnatural and improbable phenomena also. Among such, it is curious to note that temples shake and the idols of gods  laugh, weep, sing, dance or close their eyes! This is a clear indication that temples with idols installed, had already come into being by the time of this Brāhmaṇa.</p>
		<p>The śānti rites are usually sacrificial oblations with suitable mantras addressed to the deity that has been displeased.</p>

		<p>One of the two great epics of India, the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> of Vālmīki, has been the basic text for the story of Rāma. It has been the primary source of inspiration over the millennia, for many a poet who has retold the story in his own way, often adopting it to the philosophy of his life. One such work is the <i>Adbhuta Rāmāyaṇa</i> (`the Wonder that is Rāmāyaṇa'). Though atributed to Vālmīki, it is obviously a late work. Scholars are divided about its being earlier or later to another, more well-known work, the <i>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</i> (A. D. 1400). The glorification of Kālī and identifying her with Sītā induce us to think that the work must have been written at a time when reconciling the Rāma cult of the Vaiṣṇavas and the Śākta cults has become a social necessity. Also, the words in the colophon as seen from a printed text&#8212;`iti ārṣe śrīmad-rāmāyaṇe vālmīkīye ādikāvye adbhutottarakāṇḍe...'&#8212;give rise to the suspicion that the writer might have attempted to pass it off as an appendix to the <i>Uttarakāṇḍa</i> of Vālmīki's Rāmāyaṇa.</p>
		<p>The <i>Adbhuta Ramayaṇa</i> is a comparatively smaller work of 1355 verses spread over 27 sargas or chapters. Unlike the other Rāmāyaṇas it is not divided into kāṇḍas or books.</p>
		<p>The contents of the work may be summarized briefly as follows: The sage Bhāradvāja approaches the great sage Vālmīki and requests him to give the secret teaching that is hidden in his original <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> which is rather voluminous. Vālmīki replies that the real secret is that Rāma is the Highest Brahman and Sītā, the Highest Prakṛti, the power of Brahman, Then he goes on to narrate the reasons for the descent of Rāma (sargas 2 to 4) and Sītā (s. 5 to 7), which were apparently due to the curses of the sages Nārada and parvata, but really to destroy the wicked and protect the good. This is followed by the story of the birth of Sītā as the daughter of Rāvaṇa, but abandoned by his wife Maṇḍodarī, and found by Janaka, the king of Mithilā, in his field. After this, the events move at a terrific speed: Rāma's marriage, Paraśurāma's humiliation at the hands of Rāma (s. 9), Rāma's entering the forest along with Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa (The entire episode of the <i>Ayodhyākāṇḍa</i> of Vālmīki's <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> leading to Rāma's banishment is glossed over here!), Sītā's abduction by Rāvaṇa and Rāma striking friendship with Sugrīva and Hanumān (s. 10). In answer to the simple question that Hanumān asks, `Who are you?' (s.10) Rāma waxes eloquently to describe himself as the Ātman, Parameśvara, Māyāvī and Antaryāmin (s. 11 and 12). Most of the ideas and even the words are reminiscent of the <i>Bhagavadgītā</i>, and some of the Upaniṣads. This is followed by a short discourse on bhakti or devotion (s. 13) and a curious mixture of a variety of philosophical and mythological topics (s. 14). The next chapter contains a beautiful hymn of Hanumān on Rāma (s. 15). The sixteenth sarga disposes off very briefly (in 20 verses) the entire story of the <i>Yuddhakāṇḍa</i>. In the seventeenth, Sītā reveals the existence of a thousand-headed Rāvaṇa, the elder brother of the ten-headed demon, and describes him as she had heard form a brāhmaṇa in her younger days. Hearing this, Rāma starts on an invasion of the Puṣkara Dvīpa, the abode of the thousand-headed monster, in order to destroy him. In the terrific war that ensues, Rāma falls down unconscious (s. 18 to 22). Seeing this tragedy that had  overtaken Rāma and his forces, Sītā assumes the terrible form of Kālī and destroys the demon along with all his forces. She is helped in this by her innumerable emanations (s. 23). Rāma wakes up and is surprised to see Kālī there (s. 24). He praises her with a long hymn containing 1008 names (s. 25). Though called <i>Sītā-sahasranāma</i> (`thousand names of Sītā') almost all the names belong to the Śakti cult. Sītā dissolves the form of Kālī and reappears in her original form. After thus gaining victory, Rāma returns to Ayodhyā and resumes his rule (s. 26 and 27).</p>
		<p>Though this work might have served a specific purpose during the days of its composition and later, it fails to come up to the level of the <i>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</i> and the <i>Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa.</i></p>

		<p>One of the qurestions discussed frequently in Hindu metaphysical works is the relationship between God, the creator and the created world. Most of them subscribe to the view that God creates the world, sustains and supports it and dissolves it at the end of a cycle of creation. The created world cannot exist unless it is supported and sustained by him. He is thus the ādhāra (the ground and the support) and the world itself is ādheya (`that which is supported'). The relationship that subsists between them is called `ādhara-ādheya-bhāva.' The relationship that exists between the ground and a jar kept on it gives us some idea of this `ādhāra-ādheya-bhāva.'</p>

		<p>Belief in God and putting up structures to worship him or to pray to him seems to be a common trait of human beings irrespective of their geographical boundaries or differences of culture. There are evidences to show that the Hindu places of worship, called devālayas (temples, houses of God), have been existing since very ancient times. These devālayas are highly symbolic and attempt at unravelling this symbology, in concrete terms, have resulted in a regular science and art of temple construction. Apart from the usual foundation laid to support the superstructure of the temple, these works on temple construction insist on the laying of the ādhāraśilā or support-stone below the floor of the garbhagṛha (<i>sanctum sanctorum</i>).</p>
		<p>In the middle of the site for the garbhagṛha, where the idol will be installed, the ground is excavated to a pre-determined depth. A number of articles are ceremonially fixed therein, one after another, with appropriated mantras. (See ṢAḌĀDHĀRA-PRATIṢṬHĀ.) Of these, the ādhāraśilā is the first to be fixed, and at the lowest level, as the base or support. It is a square block of granite or any other hard stone, of specific dimensions. On it are placed the other articles like the pot called nidhikumbha and the lotuses of stone and metal.</p>
		<p>According to one of the interpretations of temple symbolism, the temple represents the body of the yogi (the spiritual aspirant practising yoga) with all the cakras (centres of psychic power). The  ādhāra-śilā, then, stands for the mūlādhāra-cakra (the lowest centre).</p>

	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>Among the pairs of words used often by the Hindu scriptures, the pair `dharma adharma' is perhaps the most recurrent. Since the etymological definition of `dharma' is `that which supports and sustains.' all that attempts to destory or oppose or reverse this process of supporting and sustaining comes within the purview of the word `adharma.' If dharma is the straight path that leads to abhyudaya (well-being and prosperity) and niśśreyasa (spiritual perfection), adharma is the crooked path that leads away from both. If dharma indicates actions and duties, ritualistic or otherwise, which are in conformity with the teachings of the śāstras (holy scriptures) and ācāryas (spiritual and religious leaders), and not antagonistic to sampradāya (customs and traditions), adharma stands for all errors of omission and commision.</p>
		<p>In practice however, the word is more frequently used in the sense of unrighteous deeds and conduct resulting in sin. For instance, telling lies, stealing, cheating, adultery and committing such other forbidden acts and crimes are adharma. Dereliction of duties and not discharging the responsibilities one is entrusted with, are adharma. Performing such acts as are not prescribed for one-for e.g., a brāhmaṇa taking to arms or agriculture even though there is no urgency or emergency&#8212;is also considered adharma.</p>
		<p>The personified adharma, in the mythological lore, is said to have hiṁsā (violence) as his wife, anṛta (falsehood) as his son, and nikṛti (deceit) as his daughter. Māyā (delusion), bhaya (fear), vedanā (torment), naraka (hell), duḥkha (sorrow) and mṛtyu (death) are the other offsprings coming in that lineage (<i>vide Viṣṇupurāṇa</i> 1.7). Though the details of such lists may vary, the purport is clear: adharma is at the root of all our fears, troubles and sufferings.</p>
		<p>In Jaina metaphysics, adharma is considered to be a dravya (substance) responsible for restful state and immobility of things.</p>

		<p>The ancient Hindu sages have recognised that the body and the mind form one unit is of fundamental importance in achieving anything worthwhile in life. Hence each should be kept in a healthy condition and in harmony with the other. Vyādhi (illness of the body) and ādhi (illness of the mind) are both considered to be serious obstacles in the path of progress, whether temporal of spiritual.</p>
		<p>In most general terms, anything that disturbs the equilibrium of the body is a vyādhi and anything that upsets the equipoise of the mind is an ādhi. The ariṣaḍvargas or six enemies viz., lust, anger, greed, delusion, pride and envy, as also worries and anxieties are examples of ādhi. Rāga (attachment) and dveṣa (aversion) are the root causes of all ādhis. Conquest of these will help in removing the ādhis.</p>

		</ol>	
		<p>Sorrow and suffering (duḥkha, tāpa) are inevitable in life. In fact, they are a part of life. A knowledge of their origin, causes and even categorisation helps one to minimise their effect if not eradicate them. The Hindu religious works usually call them `tāpatraya,' `the three miseries.' They are: ādhyātmika, ādhidaivika and ādhibhautika.</p>
		<p>The ādhyātmika duḥkha or tāpa is that which is caused by bodily suffering and mental anguish. Hereditary diseases like leprosy, disabilities like blindness or lameness and diseases caused by the violation of the rules of health and sanitation are classed under this. The mental agony caused by worries and anxieties, attachment and aversion, also comes under this group.</p>
		<p>The ādhidaivika duḥka or tāpa is that which is caused by daiva. The word daiva includes the power of time, nature and the unseen hand or fate. Diseases caused by the changing seasons, misery caused by the elemental forces like floods and fire, suffering caused by black magic or disembodied spirits or gods who are displeased, natural tribulations due to hunger, thirst and old-age belong to this group.</p>
		<p>The ādhibhautika duḥka or tāpa is that thiwhc is caused by other bhūtas or living beings, like wild animals, snakes, or enemies.</p>
		<p>Some of these, like hereditary diseases or physical disabilities cannot be got rid of. Hence they must be endured. Some like the diseases caused by change of seasons or the machinations of enemies can be countered by taking appropriate precautions. However, raising the mind to the level of the spirit, thus transcending the limitations imposed by the body-mind complex, is the best solution to offset the effects of tāpatraya.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>From the most ancient times, all religious activity of the Hindus was performed at times considered auspicious or suitable for them. Calculations were done based on the movements of the sun, the moon, the planets and the stars. This resulted in the growth of an entire  science of Vedic Astronomy, `Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa'.</p>
		<p>The most fundamental periods of time, common to all the nations are the day, the month and the year. The day is  due to the revolution of the earth round its axis. the month is mainly a lunar phenomenon based on the waxing and waning of the moon. The year is due to the apparent motion of the sun as seen from the earth. Hence the Hindus followed a luni-solar calendar from the ancient times, and being aware of the difference between the two ways of calculating, also provided for the necessary adjustments to be made to bring the two into consonance.  The lunar year on which are based the religious activites, is less than the solar year by about eleven days. Hence two intercalary months are added in five years, one being a second āṣāḍha (the 4th lunar month) at the end of 2 1/2 years and a second pauṣa (the 10the lunar month) at the end of another 2 1/2 years. This is according to Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa. Later works  give varying periods after which the intercalary month occurs. The general rule seems to be that the lunar month in which no saṅkrānti (apparent movement of the sun from one constellation to the next, as seen from the earth) occurs, is called an adhikamānti (apparent movement of the sun form one constellation to the next, as seen from the earth) occurs, is called an adhikamāsa and bears the same name of the next lunar month which is called śuddha or nija or prākṛta, to distinguish it from the former.</p>
		<p>Somehow, the adhikamāsa was considered even from the ancient times, inauspicious and hence named malamāsa (`the dirty month'), malimluca (`a thief'), aṁhaspati (`the lord of sins') and so on. During this month one was advised to avoid acts like consecrating Vedic fires, installing images, offering gifts, observing vratas or religious vows, performing upanayana and other saṁskāras (purificatory rites).</p>
		<p>However in some purāṇas like the <i>Padma</i> (6.64) the intercalary month is named `puruṣottama-māsa' (`month of Lord Viṣṇu'), probably with a view to reducing the opprobrium attached to it and considered, on the other hand, as holy.</p>

		<p>All people are not endowed with equal ability. To perform an act properly and efficiently one must have at least the minimum capacity and competence in that field. Training can improve it but cannot create it. This patent fact has been recognised by the Hindu scriptures and propagated under the nomenclature `adhikāra.' For instance, it is the man who is endowed with physical strength and mental courage that has the adhikāra for joining the armed forces. Similarly it is the person who is endowed with more than average intelligence, a fair degree of scholarship and a capacity to speak well, that has the adhikāra to enter the teaching profession. Again, it is the person who has practised at least to a certain degree, purity and self-control, that has the adhikāra to become a monk.</p>
		<p>In most cases, adhikāra can be developed by assiduous cultivation. One who has adhikāra is called an `adhikārin' and the doctrine that advocates the need for adhikāra is called `adhikāravāda.' The differences among the adhikārins are termed `adhikāribheda.'</p>
		<p>In this creation there is nothing that is absolute. Everything is relative. Divergences and differences do exist. The `Doctrine of Adhikāra or Adhikārabheda' is just a recognition of this patent fact. It does not necessarily suggest a gradation, with its corollary of `higher' and `lower' status, implying pride or contempt. It is more an acceptance of a fact as tis exists, helping one to understand where one stands and start one's progress from that base. Also it is designed to awaken one to one's duties rather than to one's rights and privileges.</p>

In this aspect, the two back hands hold the paraśu (battle axe) and the mṛga (antelope) and the two front hands are folded on the chest in the añjali (obeisance) pose.

		<p>As regards the origin of this deity, there are three difference accounts available in Hindu mythology. Desirous of a son, a sage Sālaṅkāyana by name, propitiated Viṣṇu, who granted his wish by producing a boy exactly resembling Śiva, from the right side of his body. He was named Nandikeśvara. According to another account, a sage called Nandi obtained the status of a god and the headship of the gaṇas of Śiva by propitiating him. A third account depicts him as emerging from the yāgaśālā (sacrificial shed) of the blind sage Śilāda, in the form of an yound lad resembling Śiva, thus bringing `nandi' or joy to him.

		<p>Temples form a very important part of the Hindu religious institutions and culture. Building of temples has developed, over the years, into a great art. Architecture and iconography have grown both vast and deep because of it. The images, though prepared strictly according to the standards of iconography, are unfit to be installed in them unless sanctified ceremonially by rites recommended in the āgamas (a class of religious works connected with temple worship). `Adhivāsa' is such a rite, making the image `live in' various substances like water and grains. The adhivāsas are three: jalādhivāsa, dhānyādhivāsa and śayyādhivāsa. The first is to remedy the effects of chiselling, the second for purifying the physical image and the last for inducing spiritual effulgence.</p>
		<p>In jalādhivāsa (`living in water'), the image is taken in a  procession round the village, placed on level ground on the bank of a river or tank, sprinkled withthe water of the same, wound round with kuśa grass and new cloth and ceremonially immersed in the water so that the head lies towards the east and mouth upwards. The duration of jalādhivāsa is from one night to nine nights, though three nights are more common. After taking it out of water, the image has to undergo physical and ceremonial cleansing once again.</p>
		<p>Dhānyādhivāsa (`living in grains') and śayyādhivāsa (`living in the bed') ar actually one ritual in practice. On the vedi (special platform) a sthaṇḍila (an esoteric geometric design) is inscribed. Grains like wheat, rice, barley and black sesame are spread and a lotus of eight petals is inscribed on the grains. A bed is now prepared over this with five materials viz., wooden plank, skin of deer or tiger, a rug of animal hair, feathers of birds and cloth. In the absense of the first four materials, five layers of cloth can be used. The image is now made to lie for three nights on this bed, with kuśa grass underneath it, the head being towards the east and mouth upwards.</p>
		<p>The word `adhivāsa' is also used in the sense of `perfuming' or sanctifying with perfumes or ther approved materials, any object or objects used in ceremonial worship.</p>

A concrete part of this sacrament is the investiture with the sacred thread called `upavīta' or `yajñopavīta' which should be worn permanently on the body. One of the three modes of wearing this upaviīta is `adhonivīta' or `adhovīta' or `saṁvīta'. In this mode, the sacred thread hangs from the neck like a garland, stretching below the navel.

		<p>The attempts at reconciling Brahman the Absolute with the world which is imperfect and limited have resulted in the `doctrine of ahdyāropa-apavāda.' The problem is sought to be resolved by considering the world as an adhyāropa or adhyāsa, a superimposition (even as a snake is superimposed on a rope resulting in illusory perception) and denying it absolute reality. The process of desuperimposition called `apavāda,' consists of negating the illusory apearances by adopting the right means of knowledge and perceiving the truth as it is. Adhyāropa is practically the same as `adhyāsa' (See <span class="wordref">ADHYĀSA</span>.) A slight shade of difference in meaning is perhaps, that adhyāropa refers to the process and adhyāsa is the result.</p>

		<p>The Advaita Vedānta philosophy, the chief exponent of which was Śaṅkara (A.D. 788-820), accepts Brahman (the Absolute), which is beyond names, forms, attributes, and hence, defies all description, as the Ultimate Reality. But the world that we perceive with its myriad names, forms and attributes, circumscribed by time, space and causation, cannot be easily brushed aside or wished away. Hence there is a great need to explain the relationship between Brahman the Absolute and this world of phenomena, `Adhyāsa' or `adhyāropa' is the explanation offered by Advaita Vedānta.</p>
		<p>Literally, the word means one thing `sitting upon' another, hiding its nature for the time being. It is defined as `the appearance elsewhere, as in memory, of something perceived earlier.' (<i>Adhyāsabhāṣya</i> of Śaṅkara, <i>Brahmasūtras</i> 1.1.1). Two oft-repeated analogies are the erroneous perception of a snake in a rope in insufficient light and of silver in nacre shining in light. In both cases, the impressions of a snake and silver fromo an earlier idea of the same are superimposed on the rope and the nacre under conditions conducive to the erroneous conditions conducive to the erroneous perception. These erroneous perceptions have been caused by the `adhyāsa' of the snake on the rope and the silver on the nacre. This again is due to ajñāna or avidyā (ignorance) of the real nature of the adhiṣṭhāna (substratum-here, the rope and the nacre). This ajñāna is anādi (without beginning) since it has no ascertainable beginning. Once this ajñāna is removed by right perception, the error disappears automatically.</p>
		<p>Using the doctrine of adhyāsa and the two analogies already mentioned, Advaita metaphysics tries to explain that the world palpably perceived by the senses is only an erroneous perception caused by adhyāsa on Brahman. Once the real nature of Brahman is realised, the world appearance ceases. At the subjective level, this adhyāsa causes the erroneous perception of the body-mind complex on the ātman (the immanent aspect of Brahman at the individual level). Once the real nature of the ātman is realised, its identification with the body-mind complex will disappear.</p>
