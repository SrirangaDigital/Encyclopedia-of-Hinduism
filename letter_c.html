	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>In the Indian philosophical systems, the word has been used widely to denote consciousness. Some systems like the Vedānta, identify it with the ātman/Brahman.</p> 
		<p>The Cārvākas (materialists) who admit of only four bhūtas or fundamental elements consider consciousness as the property of the body and a product of these elements, like the intoxicating power of a drink being produced by the chemical combination of certain things. The Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika schools consider it as a quality of the soul produced in it by its conjunction with the mind and other conditions of knowledge. The Mīmāṁsakas and Jainas also hold the same view. The Buddhist schools consider it as a series of momentary cognitions, each revealing itself. But Sāṅkhya, Yoga and Advaita Vedānta systems consider it as the very nature of the soul, knowledge being only a manifestation or reflection of consciousness on the vṛttis or modifications of the mind.</p>
		<p>These schools usually recognize three states of consciousness: jāgrat or waking state, svapna or dream state and suṣupti or deep-sleep state. In the waking state knowledge is produced by the contact of the sense-organs with the sense-objects. In the dream state it is produced through saṁskāras or past impressions, eventhough there is no contact between the senses and the objects. In the deep-sleep state, some schools like the Nyāya aver that there is no knowledge whereas the Sāṅkhya, Yoga and Vedānta schools accept the existence of a subtle kind of knowledge, a knowledge about the tamas or nescience which prevails at that time.</p> 
		<p>In some of the monastic orders of the Daśanāmī group, this word 'caitanya' is used as an appellation to indicate the state of a brahmacarin, a novice under training for monkhood.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>Caitra is the first month of the Hindu lunar calendar, and roughly corresponds to March-April. It got its name from the fact that on the full-moon day of that month, the moon would be in the asterism Citrā. Nirṛti is the supervising deity of this month. Though Citrā is no longer connected with this month now, the name still continues as such.</p>
		<p>The first day of this month is 'Yugādi' (the beginning of the yuga or Age), the New Year's day, celebrated with religious vows and worship. The eighth day of the bright half is Aśokāṣṭamī, a day on which goddess Durgā is worshipped with the flowers of the Aśoka tree. Śrī Rāmanavamī, the birthday of the epic hero Śrī Rāma, is celebrated on the next day. In the dark fortnight, Matsya Jayantī (on the fifth day) and Varāha Jayantī (on the fourteenth day) are the important festivals.</p>

However in practice, a funeral mound, a tree with a rivetment round its stem probably interring the remains of a hero, or even a building serving the same purpose, have all been designated as caityas. The term has also been used as a general nomenclature for any temple.</p>
		<p>FIGURE</p>
		<p>Over the years the word has acquired a peculiarly Buddhistic flavour. Places&#8212;with or without a monument&#8212;such as Lumbiṇī, Gayā, Vaiśālī or Rājagṛha associated with Buddha's life, have come to be known as caityas. Stūpas also have been called caityas.</p>
		<p>In the rock-cut cave temples of Buddhistic origin, Caitya Halls are seen. They are apsidal, barrel-vaulted halls used to enshrine a stūpa.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>The wheel of a chariot is frequently mentioned in the <i>Ṛgveda</i> as a symbol of the sun. In some of the hymns (<i>vide</i> 1.155.6) the sun is compared to a wheel denoting the principle of time. The <i>Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa</i> (20.1) calls the year as a revolving wheel of the gods, on which they move through all the worlds.</p>
		<p>FIGURE</p>
		<p>In the Hindu mythological lore, the cakra&#8212;translated as 'discus'&#8212;is almost exclusively described as a weapon of war, especially of Viṣṇu/Kṛṣṇa. It is called 'Sudarśana' ('that with a pleasing appearance') and is shown with six spokes. This confirms the contention of the scholars that it was originally a symbol of the sun and the six spokes represented the six ṛtus or seasons. Sometimes the Sudarśanacakra is shown personified as a minor deity with a hexagon in his background. Brilliant as fire, he has four or eight or sixteen arms holding bow, arrow, trident, noose, goad and other implements as also weapons apart from the usual Vaiṣṇavite symbols. Symbolically, he represents the cosmic mind, the will of the Lord to multiply as well as his infinite power to create and destroy the universe. The Sudarśana-mantra&#8212;a special formula pertaining to it&#8212;is said to possess the power to neutralize poisons and exorcise malignant spirits.</p>
		<p>In the mantraśāstras-sciences dealing with mystic formulae-six 'cakras' or arrangements of letters of the alphabet are described which help in determining the suitability of a particular mantra for a particular individual, depending upon his rāśi (zodiacal sign) or nakṣatra (asterism).</p>
		<p>In Buddhism, the cakra symbolizes Dharmacakra, the Wheel of Law, its eight spokes representing the eightfold path prescribed by Buddha for attaining nirvāṇa or emancipation</p>

		<p>Cakradhara, who is credited with the forming of the Mahānubhāva Sect of Maharashtra is said to have lived in the 11th cent. A.D. Some aver that the founder was Govinda Prabhu, a great mystic and Cakradhara was only the first apostle. Cakradhara composed a number of sūtras or aphorisms on this cult. This work is known as <i>Sūtrapāṭha</i> among its followers. The sect itself is of the Bhāgavata Cult and bases its teachings mainly on the <i>Gītā</i>, the Bhāgavata and the Sūtrapāṭha.</p>
		<p>The followers of this sect used to wear dark blue dress, probably in imitation of the colour of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.</p>
		<p>Though the movement started in Maharashtra, somehow it did not become very popular. Rather it fell into disrepute due to its neglect of the Vedas and disregard for the caste and the  āśrama systems. This disrepute made the writers of this sect use esoteric and symbolic language.</p>
		<p>Nāgadeva, Bhāskara, Keśavarāja Sūri and a few others were its distinguished followers. Nāgadeva is said to have organized the cult on a systematic basis. There were women followers too, some of whom were advanced mystics and poetesses of repute.</p>
		<p>In the paurāṇic and hymnal literature the word represents Viṣṇu/Nārāyṇa/Kṛṣṇa since he is the wielder of the discus-weapon (Sudarśanacakra).</p>

		<p>Āyurveda or the science of life has long been accorded a very important status among the various branches of knowledge in Hinduism. It is the first of the four Upavedas or subsidiary Vedas.</p> 
		<p>Among the extant works on this science, the two that are considered ancient and highly authoritative are <i>Caraka Saṁhitā</i> and <i>Suśruta Saṁhitā</i>. The renowned commentaries on these two works-<i>Āyurvedadīpikā</i> or <i>Carakatātparyadīpikā</i> on the former, and <i>Bhānumatī</i> on the latter-were by one Cakrapāṇidatta. He lived in the 11th cent. A. D. and was the son of Nārāyaṇa, an official at the court of the king Nayapāla of Gauḍadeśa. Naradatta was the teacher under whom he was trained.</p>

		<span class="word">cakrapūjā</span> <span class="word_def">('worship in a circle')</span>
	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>The cult of the Devī or the Divine Mother, though originating from the <i>Ṛgveda</i> itself (<i>vide</i> 10.125) gradually developed into two main channels: the dakṣiṇamārga or the right-handed path and the vāmamārga or the left-handed path. The latter was perhaps a grotesque metamorphosis brought about by nonVedic aboriginal and primitive cults. As a result many sex-rites made their way into this left-handed path. The tāntric literature is replete with such rites.</p>
		<p>One such abominable rite is the cakrapūjā or 'worship in a circle'. According to the <i>Kaulāvalīnirṇaya</i>, an equal number of men and women, without distinction of caste or even blood relationship, secretly meet at night and sit in a circle. The goddess is represented by a yantra or diagram. The women cast their bodices in a receptacle and each of the assembled men finds a female companion for that night by picking up a bodice from the same</p>
		<p>Scholars are of the view that what might have been simple fertility rites of the ancient days, aimed at increasing agricultural production, might have degenerated into such sex-orgies in the name of religion, especially because of the perverted sexual desires of the wealthy and the powerful persons in the society</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>The Śākta Āgamas, more commonly known as the tantras, declare that the human body is a little universe in itself and that the various tattvas or cosmic principles in creation are there embedded in it. However, each of these tattvas has it own centre of activity, the place where it is most preponderant and from where its energies radiate into the system. They have been called 'cakras' (circles or centres) and have often been likened to lotuses. They are not anatomical centres like the nerve-plexuses but subtle seats of consciousness, of Śakti or divine Power.</p> 
		<p>FIGURE</p>
		<p>Works on Yoga depict fourteen principal nāḍīs or subtle conduits for the flow of prāṇic energy, of which the suṣumnā, the iḍā and the piṅgalā are the most important ones. The suṣumnā is situated inside the spinal column and iḍā and piṅgalā entwine it from left and right. All the three start from the root of the spinal column and end near the centre of the head.</p>
		<p>Six cakras are described as being situated in this Suṣumnā. They are mūlādhāra, svādhiṣṭhāna, maṇipūra, anāhata, viśuddha and ājñā. The seventh, the sahasrāra, is the final destination of the Kuṇḍalinīśakti, the basic power of the human organism which is likened to a coiled serpent lying dormant at the mūlādhāra, until it is roused by appropriate yogic exercises.</p>
		<p>The mūlādhāracakra is situated in the space between the anus and the generative organ, at the root of the suṣumnānāḍī. It resembles a crimson lotus of four petals. It is the centre of the principle of earth&#8212;pṛthvītattva&#8212;and controls the sense-organ of smell as also feet, one of the organs of action. Brahmā, along with his Śakti Sāvitrī, is the presiding deity of this cakra.</p> 
		<p>The svādhiṣṭhānacakra, next in the series, is situated at the root of the genitals and is placed inside the suṣumnā. It resembles a lotus of vermillion colour with six petals. It is the centre of the principle of water&#8212;the aptattva&#8212;and controls the sense organ of taste and also the hands from among the organs of action. Viṣṇu along with his Śakti Rākiṇī, is the presiding deity of this centre.</p>
		<p>Then comes maṇipūra, at the navel region. It resembles a lotus of dark hue (like the rain clouds) with ten petals. It is the centre of the principle of fire&#8212;tejastattva&#8212;and controls the sense-organ of sight and the organ of action, the anus. Rudra with his Śakti Lākinī is the presiding deity.</p>
		<p>The anāhata, situated in the region of the heart, resembles a lotus of twelve petals of blood-red colour. It is the centre of the principle of air&#8212;vāyutattva&#8212;and controls the sense of touch and the genitals. Īśa with his Śakti Kākinī, is the presiding deity.</p> 
		<p>Next comes the viśuddhacakra, in the region of the base of the throat. It resembles a lotus of sixteen petals of smoky purple colour. It is the locus of the principle of ether&#8212;ākāśatattva&#8212;and controls the organ of hearing as also of speech. Sadāśiva with his Śākinī Śakti is the presiding deity</p>
		<p>Last of this series of cakras, often designated as 'ṣaṭcakras', is the ājñācakra situated in the region corresponding to the middle of the eyebrows. It resembles a lotus of two petals of white colour. It is the centre of the principle of mind. Śambhu with his Śakti Hākinī is the presiding deity.</p>
		<p>Beyond this there is the sahasrāracakra, resembling a white lotus of a thousand petals, presided over by Paramaśiva himself. It hangs from the brahmarandhra (opening at the top of the skull) and above the suṣumnā, head downwards</p>
		<p>In fact all these cakras hang head downwards only, until they are pierced by the Kuṇḍalinī, after it is roused from its slumber by appropriate yogic practices. This piercing of the cakras by the Kuṇḍalinī is called 'ṣaṭcakrabheda'. When the Kuṇḍalinī reaches the sahasrāra and gets united with Paramaśiva, the yogi will go into samādhi, the superconscious state, experiencing ineffable bliss.</p>
		<p>The tantras also describe the various results that accrue to a person who contemplates on these cakras in the prescribed manner.</p>

		<p>Any holy place, place of pilgrimage, associated with the cakra or discus of Lord Viṣṇu, becomes a 'Cakratīrtha'. The mythological works mention several Cakratīrthas. However, a few of them only, which are more well-known in the modem times, may be mentioned here.</p>
		<p>One of the 24 ponds near Rāmeśvaram (in Tamil Nadu) where the pilgrims have their bath, is called 'Cakratīrtha'. The local legend states that the Sudarśana-cakra of Lord Viṣṇu, which was pursuing the sage Durvāsas who had offended Ambarīṣa, a great devotee of Lord Viṣṇu, entered into the pond here and disappeared.</p>
		<p>There is one Cakratīrtha near Prabhāsa (the modern Somnath, in Gujarat). Lord Viṣṇu is supposed to have washed his cakra or discus here after killing all the demons in a battle</p>
		<p>Another Cakratīrtha is situated about six miles from Tryambaka near Nāsik in Maharashtra</p>
		<p>Chakdhar in Kashmir considered to be a place of great sanctity, associated with Lord Viṣṇu, is also known as 'Cakradhara' or 'Cakratīrtha'</p>

		<p>The concept of an emperor, a sovereign monarch ruling over vast areas and having vassal kings, is not unknown to the ancient Hindu scriptures. The <i>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa</i> (ch. 39) mentions the names of several emperors such as Janamejaya, Śatānīka and Bharata. In the later recorded history, several kings have tried to attain the status of emperors. Aśoka, Harṣavardhana and Samudra Gupta are instances to the point.</p> 
		<p>The word 'cakravartin' along with the word 'samrāṭ' has commonly been used to denote an emperor. Literally, the word may mean 'one whose cakra or wheel of the chariot rotates (vartanam = rotation) unimpeded,' thereby signifying his absolute conquest over the land. According to the science of Hindu physiognomy, anyone who has the sign of a 'cakra' (wheel, discus or lotus) on his hand is a 'cakravartin,' and is destined to become an emperor.</p>
		<p>Sometimes the word 'cakra' is interpreted as 'maṇḍala' or circle of kings, cakravartin being their overlord</p>
		<p>A cakravartin is said to possess 'seven jewels' (saptaratna). They are: cakra, chariot, jewel, queen, wealth, horse and elephant. Here 'cakra' may mean the auspicious sign of the Sudarśanacakra of Lord Viṣṇu on his hand.</p>

		<p>Eye is the most important of all the sense organs. The sun is described by the Vedas as the eye of all that exists.</p>
		<p>According to the Upaniṣads the power to see that exists in the eye, and the power of light capable of revealing objects, that exists in the sun, are both essentially the same; and, Āditya is the deity that presides over both. When a human being dies, his 'eye' (the power to see) gets merged in the Āditya.</p> 
		<p>Belief in the evil influence of the eyes of some people (dṛṣṭidoṣa) is common to India as to many other countries. It is said to cause death, illness, injury, poverty and other evil effects. Children and animals are said to be more vulnerable to it. Hence the use of amulets, countercharms and protective gestures has been resorted to over the years. According to the <i>Atharvaveda</i>, an amulet of the 'jiṅgiḍa' plant gives such protection. The same Veda (2.7.5) contains a hymn called 'Cakṣurmantra' directed against curses and those who curse, the invoker requesting for the possessor of the 'evil eye' to be harmed (so that he will not harm others).</p>

		<p>Śivaliṅgas or emblems of Śiva, the third deity of the Hindu Trinity, are of two types: acalaliṅgas and calaliṅgas. The former are immovable or fixed, whereas the latter are movable or portable. Stone lingas fixed in temples belong to the former category.</p>
		<p>The calaliṅgas are of various types: mṛṇmaya (made of earth or clay), lohaja (prepared out of metal), ratnaja (shaped out of precious stones), dāruja (carved out of wood), śailaja (made of stone) and kṣaṇika-liṅgas (those prepared temporarily for the occasion and disposed off, like the ones made out of riverside clay or cooked rice).</p>
		<p>White clay gathered from pure places such as hilltops or river-beds is recommended for mṛṇmayaliṅgas. The' lohaja liṅigas are generally cast from metals like gold, silver or copper. The ratnaja variety is shaped out of precious stones like pearls, coral, topaz or emerald. The timber of trees like śamī (<i>Prosposis spicegera</i>), madhuka (<i>Bass is latifolia</i>), arjuna (<i>Terminalia arjuna</i>) pippala (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>) or udumbara (<i>Ficus glomerata</i>) is recommended for dāruliṅgas. The śailaja or stone liṅgas are generally worn on the body by the followers of Śaiva cults like the liṅgāyats. The kṣaṇika liṅgas are shaped out of riverside sand or clay, uncooked or cooked rice, cowdung, butter, sandal paste, flour or jaggery. They are made for the occasion and then disposed off, soon after the worship is over.</p>
		<p>Worship of different kinds of liṅgas confers different results. For instance, that of gold liṅga gives wealth; that of cooked rice, plenty of food; that of cowdung, freedom from diseases.</p>
		<p>Baked clay liṅgas are used for ābhicārika purposes, i.e., for harming others through black magic.</p>

		<p>Out of the several implements used in a Vedic sacrifice, 'camasa' is an important one. It is a kind of cup, with or without a handle, usually square in shape and made of the nyagrodha wood (<i>Ficus indica</i>). The handle could be round, square or even triangular.</p>
		<p>FIGURE</p>
		<p>It is generally used for containing the Soma juice for libation, for drinking the same by priests, and for bringing the 'praṇītā' waters for making dough for the caru in a sacrifice. (See <span class="wordref">PRAṆĪTĀ</span>.)</p>
		<p>Out of the sixteen priests involved in a sacrifice, only ten are entitled to have camas a and they are called 'camasins'.</p>
		<p>The <i>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</i> (2.2.3) compares the human head to a camasa, kept inverted.</p>

		<p>Campā, variously known as Campāpurī, Campakāvatī, Campānagara and so on, was the capital of the once well-known Aṅgadeśa. Romapāda, father of Śāntā and father-in-law of the famous sage Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, was the king here in very ancient times. <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> mentions it. During the times of the <i>Mahābhārata</i> Karṇa was ruling from here.</p>
		<p>It has been identified with Nathnagar near Bhagalpur in Bihar.</p>
		<p>Some scholars opine that the famous Buddhist work, the <i>Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra</i> was composed here probably in the 4th century A.D.</p>
		<p>Campā is said to be the birthplace of Vāsupūjya, the twelfth Tīrthaṅkara and also associated with the last, Mahāvīra.</p>
		<p>Hindu religion, culture and way of life had spread beyond the borders of India even from the ancient days. There are archaeological, epigraphical and other evidences to prove its existence in the South East Asian countries from the 1st century A.D. The kingdom of Campā&#8212;the South Annam region of Vietnam&#8212;is a country of this group.</p>
		<p>One Śrīmāra established a Hindu dynasty there in A. D. 192. The kingdom itself&#8212;though the rulers changed now and then-continued till A. D. 1471 when it was annexed by the kings of Annam.</p>
		<p>Among the several distinguished rulers of Campā, the names of Bhadravarma, Rudravarma, Harivarma, Mahendravarma, Jayasiṁhavarma and Jaya Indravarma may be mentioned. They were all Hindu rulers and had adopted Hindu ways of administration. Most of them were well-versed in Sanskrit and Hindu sciences, both religious and secular. Hence they had adopted Sanskrit as the State language.</p>
		<p>In the social fabric, the varṇa-āśrama system had been deeply rooted. The various saṁskāras (religio-social sacraments) like marriage, were being done by the priests according to the Hindu dharmaśāstras.</p>
		<p>Though Śaivism had been patronized by the State, Vaiṣṇavism and Buddhism also flourished. Several Hindu temples including innumerable images of Śiva as also liṅgas, have been discovered. However, these temples are smaller in size and are built mostly in brick. In architectural style they resemble the 'rathas' of Mahābalipuram or the temples of Bādāmi in Karnataka.</p>

		<p>Mother worship and Mother cult are not alien to Vedic religion as some suggest. The concept of Aditi (mother of gods and a personification of nature) as also the Ambhṛṇīsūkta and the Rātrisūkta of the Ṛgveda clearly contain the origins of the worship of God as Śakti or the Divine Mother.</p>
		<p>FIGURE</p>
		<p>One of the early basic texts of the Śakti cult is the Devīmāhātmya also called Durgāsaptaśatī or Caṇḍī. According to this, Kālī, one of the aspects of Durgā that emanated from her forehead, killed the two demons Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa, generals of the demon king Śumbha, and got this name. She is described as a fierce goddess, black in colour, emaciated and wearing the cheetah skin as also severed human heads. Her mouth and tongue were of immense proportions. She could kill troups of demons at one stroke and could swallow several elephants in a gulp.</p>
		<p>Cāmuṇḍā is sometimes included in the list of 'Saptamātṛkās' or 'Seven Mothers', in the place of Nārasiṁhī.</p>
		<p>She actually symbolizes the power of time in its all-destroying aspect</p>
		<p>The word is also spelt as Cāmuṇḍī.</p>

		<p>From the Vedic days certain groups of people used to be kept outside the pale of civilized society. 'Aspṛśyas' or 'untouchables' was the general name given to most of them since any kind of contact or proximity with them was considered polluting. This was mostly due to their horrendous ways of living and avocations</p>
