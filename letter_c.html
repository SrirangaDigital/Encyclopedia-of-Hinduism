	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>In the Indian philosophical systems, the word has been used widely to denote consciousness. Some systems like the Vedānta, identify it with the ātman/Brahman.</p> 
		<p>The Cārvākas (materialists) who admit of only four bhūtas or fundamental elements consider consciousness as the property of the body and a product of these elements, like the intoxicating power of a drink being produced by the chemical combination of certain things. The Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika schools consider it as a quality of the soul produced in it by its conjunction with the mind and other conditions of knowledge. The Mīmāṁsakas and Jainas also hold the same view. The Buddhist schools consider it as a series of momentary cognitions, each revealing itself. But Sāṅkhya, Yoga and Advaita Vedānta systems consider it as the very nature of the soul, knowledge being only a manifestation or reflection of consciousness on the vṛttis or modifications of the mind.</p>
		<p>These schools usually recognize three states of consciousness: jāgrat or waking state, svapna or dream state and suṣupti or deep-sleep state. In the waking state knowledge is produced by the contact of the sense-organs with the sense-objects. In the dream state it is produced through saṁskāras or past impressions, eventhough there is no contact between the senses and the objects. In the deep-sleep state, some schools like the Nyāya aver that there is no knowledge whereas the Sāṅkhya, Yoga and Vedānta schools accept the existence of a subtle kind of knowledge, a knowledge about the tamas or nescience which prevails at that time.</p> 
		<p>In some of the monastic orders of the Daśanāmī group, this word 'caitanya' is used as an appellation to indicate the state of a brahmacarin, a novice under training for monkhood.</p>

		<span class="word">Caitra</span> <span class="word_def">('with Citrā')</span>
	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>Caitra is the first month of the Hindu lunar calendar, and roughly corresponds to March-April. It got its name from the fact that on the full-moon day of that month, the moon would be in the asterism Citrā. Nirṛti is the supervising deity of this month. Though Citrā is no longer connected with this month now, the name still continues as such.</p>
		<p>The first day of this month is 'Yugādi' (the beginning of the yuga or Age), the New Year's day, celebrated with religious vows and worship. The eighth day of the bright half is Aśokāṣṭamī, a day on which goddess Durgā is worshipped with the flowers of the Aśoka tree. Śrī Rāmanavamī, the birthday of the epic hero Śrī Rāma, is celebrated on the next day. In the dark fortnight, Matsya Jayantī (on the fifth day) and Varāha Jayantī (on the fourteenth day) are the important festivals.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>Citā' is the funeral pyre. 'Caitya' is anything that is connected with it. However in practice, a funeral mound, a tree with a rivetment round its stem probably interring the remains of a hero, or even a building serving the same purpose, have all been designated as caityas. The term has also been used as a general nomenclature for any temple.</p>
		<p>FIGURE</p>
		<p>Over the years the word has acquired a peculiarly Buddhistic flavour. Places&#8212;with or without a monument&#8212;such as Lumbiṇī, Gayā, Vaiśālī or Rājagṛha associated with Buddha's life, have come to be known as caityas. Stūpas also have been called caityas.</p>
		<p>In the rock-cut cave temples of Buddhistic origin, Caitya Halls are seen. They are apsidal, barrel-vaulted halls used to enshrine a stūpa.</p>

		<span class="word">cakra</span> <span class="word_def">(`wheel')</span>
	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>The wheel of a chariot is frequently mentioned in the <i>Ṛgveda</i> as a symbol of the sun. In some of the hymns (<i>vide</i> 1.155.6) the sun is compared to a wheel denoting the principle of time. The <i>Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa</i> (20.1) calls the year as a revolving wheel of the gods, on which they move through all the worlds.</p>
		<p>FIGURE</p>
		<p>In the Hindu mythological lore, the cakra&#8212;translated as 'discus'&#8212;is almost exclusively described as a weapon of war, especially of Viṣṇu/Kṛṣṇa. It is called 'Sudarśana' ('that with a pleasing appearance') and is shown with six spokes. This confirms the contention of the scholars that it was originally a symbol of the sun and the six spokes represented the six ṛtus or seasons. Sometimes the Sudarśanacakra is shown personified as a minor deity with a hexagon in his background. Brilliant as fire, he has four or eight or sixteen arms holding bow, arrow, trident, noose, goad and other implements as also weapons apart from the usual Vaiṣṇavite symbols. Symbolically, he represents the cosmic mind, the will of the Lord to multiply as well as his infinite power to create and destroy the universe. The Sudarśana-mantra&#8212;a special formula pertaining to it&#8212;is said to possess the power to neutralize poisons and exorcise malignant spirits.</p>
		<p>In the mantraśāstras-sciences dealing with mystic formulae-six 'cakras' or arrangements of letters of the alphabet are described which help in determining the suitability of a particular mantra for a particular individual, depending upon his rāśi (zodiacal sign) or nakṣatra (asterism).</p>
		<p>In Buddhism, the cakra symbolizes Dharmacakra, the Wheel of Law, its eight spokes representing the eightfold path prescribed by Buddha for attaining nirvāṇa or emancipation</p>

		<p>Cakradhara, who is credited with the forming of the Mahānubhāva Sect of Maharashtra is said to have lived in the 11th cent. A.D. Some aver that the founder was Govinda Prabhu, a great mystic and Cakradhara was only the first apostle. Cakradhara composed a number of sūtras or aphorisms on this cult. This work is known as <i>Sūtrapāṭha</i> among its followers. The sect itself is of the Bhāgavata Cult and bases its teachings mainly on the <i>Gītā</i>, the Bhāgavata and the Sūtrapāṭha.</p>
		<p>The followers of this sect used to wear dark blue dress, probably in imitation of the colour of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.</p>
		<p>Though the movement started in Maharashtra, somehow it did not become very popular. Rather it fell into disrepute due to its neglect of the Vedas and disregard for the caste and the  āśrama systems. This disrepute made the writers of this sect use esoteric and symbolic language.</p>
		<p>Nāgadeva, Bhāskara, Keśavarāja Sūri and a few others were its distinguished followers. Nāgadeva is said to have organized the cult on a systematic basis. There were women followers too, some of whom were advanced mystics and poetesses of repute.</p>
		<p>In the paurāṇic and hymnal literature the word represents Viṣṇu/Nārāyṇa/Kṛṣṇa since he is the wielder of the discus-weapon (Sudarśanacakra).</p>

		<span class="word">cakraka</span> <span class="word_def">('[arguing] in a circle')</span>
	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>This is one of the defects of logic while trying to prove a point. For instance, the arguments for and against the existence of God as the intelligent Creator could run something like this:-</p> 
		<p>Statement:</p>
		<p>This world was created by an intelligent agent.'</p>
		<p>Objection:</p>
		<p>'Since no intelligent creator in this world is seen without a body, then God also must have a body.'</p>
		<p>Reply:</p>
		<p>'No. You should consider the general sense of intelligent agentship only.'</p>
		<p>Objection:</p>
		<p>'But this is impossible! Give us an example of an effect that is produced by an intelligent agent who does not have a body.'</p>
		<p>Reply:</p>
		<p>'For instance, the shoots of corn growing in the field. They have no intelligent human agent behind them.'</p>
		<p>Objection:</p>
		<p>'Then, how did they grow?'</p>
		<p>Reply:</p>
		<p>'By God's agency.'</p>
		<p>This is 'cakraka' or arguing in a circle since the concept that was sought to be proved viz., God, was itself given as an answer at the end without proving it.</p>
