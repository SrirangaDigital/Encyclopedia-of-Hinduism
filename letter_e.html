		<p><i>Introduction</i></p>
		<p>The Upaniṣads aver that whatever good is done with full knowledge and awareness becomes forceful and fruitful in life. Bhartṛhari, a well-known Sanskrit poet, compares a man without any education to a brute. Albert Einstein (A. D. 1879-1955) seems to concur with him when he likens a man with a specialized knowledge, but lacking in values, to a well-trained dog!</p>
		<p>Vivekānanda, the great patriot-prophet of Modern India, who could feel the pulse of the Indian nation, states that:</p>
		<ol class="alpha">
			<li>Education is the panacea for all our ills.</li>
			<li>It is the manifestation of the perfection already in man.</li>
			<li>It is the training by which the current and expression of will are brought under control and become fruitful in life.</li>
			<li>It is life-building, man-making, character-making assimilation of ideas.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It is rather astonishing that many Western savants<sup><a href="#fn1">*</a></sup> have practically echoed Vivekānanda's ideas though in different words.</p>
		<p>These can be briefly summarized as follows:</p>
		<ol class="alpha">
			<li>Education should teach our children self-control, the art of holding one's passions and prejudices.</li>
			<li>It should instil true and worthy motives, a profound religious feeling and inspire the formation of a great character.</li>
			<li>It should help us to understand the laws of God in nature and to shape our lives to be in consonance with those laws.</li>
			<li>It should pay much greater attention to the development of the powers of the mind than mere learning of facts.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The ancient and medieval systems of education recognized all these aspects while formulating the policies guiding them. Accordingly all fields of vidyā or knowledge were divided into two broad streams: the parāvidyā (the higher knowledge, the spiritual wisdom) and the aparāvidyā (the lower knowledge, the secular sciences). Tbe latter is needed to live a comfortable life here. The former helps one to be fully prepared for the hereafter. Hence a balanced combination of both, is advocated so that both civilization and culture are imparted.</p>
		<p>It is very interesting to note that even an ancient Upaniṣad&#8212;the <i>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</i>&#8212;assigned to the period 4000 B. C. to 2500 B. C., mentions as many as fifteen branches of knowledge apart from the four Vedas! Some of them are: Vyākaraṇa (grammar), Pitrya (science of obsequial rites), Gaṇita (mathematics), Daiva (knowledge of the portents), Tarka (logic), Ekāyana (ethics), Bhūtavidyā (science of the spirits), Dhanurveda (martial arts and sciences), Jyautiṣa (astronomy) and Devajanavidyā (the art of preparing perfumes, music, dancing and sculpture).</p>
		<p><i>Constituents of an Educational System</i></p>
		<p>The three constituents of an educational system are: the teacher, the student and the content as also the methods of education.</p>
		<p>A spiritual teacher&#8212;generally called 'guru' or 'ācārya,<sup><a href="#fn2">1</a></sup>&#8212;was expected to be a 'śrotriya' (learned in the Vedas and allied scriptures) and a 'brahmaniṣṭha' (well-established in Brahman or God). As applied to other fields of knowledge it could mean that he should be an expert both in theory and in practice. An impeccable character, earnestness to teach and a genuine love towards the student were the additional qualities expected in him.</p>
		<p>Eagerness to learn, humility, obedience to the teacher, self-control, absence of laziness in the pursuit of knowledge and willingness to do personal service to the teacher&#8212;these were the essential traits a student must possess, to qualify for admission.</p>
		<p><i>Gurukulas</i></p>
		<p>The teachers kept their students in their own houses. When the number of students became large, these houses would grow into institutions called 'gurukulas,' established by the society, the kings and the rich endowing them with sufficient property and funds so that they could provide quality education, free of cost, to all the students.</p>
		<p>As a result, these gurukulas or educational academies grew to enormous dimensions&#8212;both in quality and quantity&#8212;thus fulfilling the significance of their very names: guru = enormous, kula = institution. It was not uncommon to find as many as ten thousand students in some of these bigger institutions. Not only out of necessity, but also as a good practice, the senior and better qualified students were made to teach the novices and also supervise over their life and discipline. Though punishments for transgressions existed they were not very severe. Incorrigible students were expelled to save the discipline and reputation of the institution.</p>
		<p>For imparting parāvidyā or spiritual wisdom, an earnest desire to learn and a willingness to undergo tapas or austerity were the only requirements. Neither varṇa nor āśrama nor age seems to have mattered.</p>
		<p>However, for the study of the Vedas and allied sciences like the Vedāṅgas,<sup><a href="#fn3">2</a></sup> some restrictions had been imposed. It was open only to the dvijas (the 'twice-born,' the members of the first three castes) and that too after the boys had undergone the upanayana<sup><a href="#fn4">3</a></sup> ceremony.</p>
		<p>Now, some additional, but miscellaneous, information can be given to get a more complete picture of the system over the centuries:</p>
		<p>Scholarly disputations and philosophical discussions used to take place even in the Vedic period, in meetings generally known as 'samiti' or 'samāja' or 'pariṣad'.</p>
		<p>Vārāṇasī or Kāśī and Takṣaśilā were well-known as great centres of learning even from the 8th century B. C. Some cities like Pāṭalīputra, Vidiśā and Kāñcīpuram were called 'ghaṭikāsthānas,' centres capable of measuring the scholarship of the savants. In such centres there was provision to get training in 14 to 18 branches of learning.<sup><a href="#fn5">4</a></sup> Students were free to acquire a deep knowledge of their religion without any hindrance from the followers of other religions.</p>
		<p>The universities of Takṣaśilā (400 B. C.), Vikramaśilā (A. D. 800) and Nālandā (A.D. 600) had attained phenomenal growth and fame. These universities had several mahāpāṭhaśālās (colleges) and each of these again comprised several lecture halls. There were three huge buildings housing big libraries of invaluable manuscripts.</p>
		<p>Admission tests were very strict and only 20&#37; of the aspirants could succeed in getting admission.</p>
		<p>In the Nālandā University alone there were 8500 students, taught by 1500 teachers with at least 100 lectures delivered per day. Professors like Nāgārjuna, Vasubandhu and Diṅnāga were internationally reputed scholars attracting a large number of students from many foreign countries like China, Japan, Korea, Turkestan, Burma, Gāndhāra (Afghanisthan), Sumātra and Persia. Though education was mostly residential and free, students who could afford to pay, did so.</p>
		<p>Among the residential students Buddhist nuns were also there. However, according to Hiuen Tsang (A. D. 600-664) and I-Tsing (A. D. 635-713), not eyen a single instance of misconduct had been noticed or discovered, thanks to the high degree of moral discipline kept up by the teachers and the administrators.</p>
		<p>Apart from these Buddhist universities, we learn from Kauṭilya (300 B. C.) and others that there were industrial and vocational training institutions too, imparting specialized training in those branches.</p>
		<p>From all these accounts we find that the educational system of the ancient and medieval India was not only highly developed but also capable of delivering to us a lesson or two even now.</p>
		<p><i>Script, Language and Literature</i></p>
		<p>A passing reference may now be made to some allied topics like the evolution of the script, language and literature. The art of writing was known even during the Vedic age though memorization was preferred and encouraged. The two scripts&#8212;Brāhmī and Kharoṣṭhī&#8212;are known to have existed even in 600 B. C. Both the Devanāgarī and some of the South Indian scripts are its evolutes. Tālapatra (palm-leaf), Bhūrjapatra (birch-bark), wooden plates, cloth (of cotton or silk), leather, stone and bricks were used for writing.</p>
		<p>Evidence is not lacking to conclude that Sanskrit works existed even as early as 600 to 100 B. C. Apart from the Vedas, the epics&#8212;the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> and the <i>Mahābhārata</i>&#8212;stand out as monuments of exquisitely beautiful literature of a very high standard. The ease and facility with which the Sanskrit language has been used even in the composition of technical subjects bearing on liturgy, medical and health sciences, ethics or linguistics, is astounding.</p>
		<p>The Prākṛt language&#8212;a popular derivative of Sanskrit&#8212;also had been fairly well-developed even by 500 B. C.</p>
		<p>The following table gives the approximate periods of the evolution of the earliest literary works in other Indian languages:</p>

		<p>A few important literary works in these languages composed during the early and the medieval periods may now be cited:</p>
		<p>Works of Hemasarasvatī, Harihara Vipra and Śaṅkara Deva in Assamese; the Maṅgala and the Vijaya literature in Bengali; works of Narasī Mehtā and Rāmānanda in Gujarati; compositions of Tulasīdas, Mīra, Vidyāpati and Kabīr in Hindi; grammar and mythological literature of Keśirāja, Pampa, Ranna and Harihara as also the religious literature of the Śivaśaraṇas and Haridāsas of Kannada; works of Jñāneśvar, Eknāth, Tukārām and others in Marathi; Pañcasakhās' works in Oriya; the <i>Guru-Granth Sāhīb</i> in Punjabi; the <i>Kuraḷ</i> of Tiruvaḷḷuvar, the <i>Tevārams</i> and the <i>Divyaprabandhams</i> of Tamil saints in Tamil; the poetical works of Śrīnātha, Potana, Vemana and Aṇṇamācārya in Telugu.</p>
		<p>From all these, we can conclude that the Indian languages and literature had attained considerable growth and refinement even by the middle ages.</p>

		<p>Burning the effigy of a person religiously (this is called ākṛtidahana) has been recommended by the dharmaśāstras in such cases where there is enough evidence to believe that he might have died and neither the body nor its parts were available for cremation.</p>
		<p>An effigy is prepared out of palāśa (<i>Butea frondosa</i>) stalks and leaves, 360 in number. These stalks are used in the prescribed manner such as 40 pieces for the head, 20 for the chest, 30 for the abdomen and so on. If he had kept the Vedic fires, then, his sacrificial vessels are also to be consigned to the fire as in a regular cremation when the body is available.</p>
		<p>In case the person were alive and returned, then, all the saṁskāras or sacraments had to be repeated again including remarrying his own wife.</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>Ekādaśī, the eleventh day of every pakṣa or fortnight of the lunar month, is to be observed as a vrata or religious rite, the main part of it being fasting. This fasting can be of four types, of which the 'ekabhakta' is the first. It permits a person who is observing ekādaśī, to eat only once (= eka) in 24 hours. The normal time prescribed for this taking of food is a little after noon.</p>
		<p>Ekabhakta can be observed as a vrata independent of ekādaśī also. The <i>Mahābhārata</i> dilates upon the rewards attained by observing ekabhakta for one year from Mārgaśīrṣa (December) to Kārttika (next November) (<i>Anuśāsanaparva</i> 107.13-126).</p>

		<span class="word">ekabhavika doctrine</span> <span class="word_def">('the doctrine [that many karmas] produce one birth')</span>
	</div>
	<div class="mng">
		<p>The doctrine of karma and punarjanma (rebirth) has been widely accepted by almost all the schools of Indian philosophy.</p>
		<p>There is a long discussion of some of the details of this doctrine in the <i>Vyāsabhāṣya</i> on the <i>Yogasūtras</i> (2.73) of Patañjali (200 B. C.). It is here that this word 'ekabhavika' has been introduced and discussed. Literally, it means 'producing one birth'.</p>
		<p>As regards residual karma producing rebirth, four alternatives are put forth and only one is accepted as true, ruling out the other three. The alternatives are:</p>
		<ol class="arabic">
			<li>Does one karma produce one birth?</li>
			<li>Does one karma cause several births?</li>
			<li>Do several karmas result in several births?</li>
			<li>Do several karmas give rise to only one birth?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Since numberless karmas have accumulated from beginningless time, accepting either of the first two alternatives will give rise to a highly confusing situation and people will lose all faith in the karmas prescribed by the śāstras.</p>
		<p>The third alternative too has to be ruled out since it is not possible for a jīva (individual soul) to assume several births simultaneously.</p>
		<p>Then, by pariśeṣanyāya or the doctrine of elimination of the alternatives, we have to accept only the last alternative as true.</p>
		<p>Among the accumulated karmas, one major karma, along with several minor karmas which are compatible with the major one, becomes ripe at the time of death and causes the next birth, deciding its jāti (type), āyus (duration of life) and bhoga (experiences, good and bad).</p>

A fierce demon Bakāsura by name, was living nearby. He used to attack this little town and would eat up whomsoever he could lay his hands on. Then the people of the town appealed to him not do so, but would themselves send a person everyday as his food. When Kuntī came to know of this through her hosts, whose turn it was to send a member of their family, she sent Bhīma instead. Bhīma killed the demon thus ridding the town of the great tormentor.</p>

		<p>A daṇḍa or a staff is an important insignia of a saṁnyāsin (monk). Among such saṁnyāsins called 'daṇḍis', there are two types: ekadaṇḍis and tridaṇḍis. The former carry only one (eka = one) staff (of bamboo) where as the latter carry three sticks tied together (tri = three) as one, to facilitate carrying.</p>
		<p>The daṇḍa stands for dama or self-control. If tridaṇḍa stands for control over body, speech and mind, ekadaṇḍa stands for control over the mind only, since that automatically leads to the control of the other two also.</p>
		<p>The paramahaṁsa saṁnyāsins accept a daṇḍa at the time of taking saṁnyāsa, but break it and discard it in a river, since they are supposed to have attained the highest state wherein they do not need to carry such insignias.</p>

		<p>Even in the mind of an average ignorant Hindu, ekādaśī and upavāsa (fasting) have practically become synonymous! Fasting as a spiritual discipline&#8212;whether as an expiation for sins committed or for gaining self-control&#8212;has been an age-old practice. When fasting reduces the sway of the flesh over the mind, it is much easier to control it and direct it towards God, so that it can 'live near him'. In fact, this is the literal meaning of the word 'upavāsa' (upa = near, vāsa = living).</p>
		<p>Ekādaśī (eleventh day in both halves of the lunar month&#8212;śuklapakṣa and kṣṇapakṣa) can be observed just as a spiritual discipline or as a 'vrata' with all the concomitant rules. Again, if observed as a vrata, it can be 'nitya' (compulsory) or 'kāmya' (motivated by desires). In the former case only śukla ekādaśīs need be observed. As a kāmya-vrata, it can be observed on both the days.</p>
		<p>Whenever it is undertaken as a vrata, apart from the fasting, saṅkalpa (resolve), worship of Viṣṇu and jāgaraṇa (keeping vigil in the night) become obligatory. It is interesting to note that ekādaśī is also called "Harivāsara' (Hari's or Viṣṇu's day) and only worship of Viṣṇu has been prescribed. In fact, for the Vaiṣṇavas (those belonging to the cult of Viṣṇu) it is compulsory! Since fasting and keeping vigil on the Māsaśivarātri days (caturdaśī of kṛṣṇapakṣa in every month) was compulsory for the Śaivas, they may have been omitted from its purview.</p>
		<p>The purāṇas and the dharmaśāstras, though they prohibit the partaking of cooked food on ekādaśī days, have made many concessions to the general human weakness towards food. If one eats only once in the day around noon, it is called 'ekabhukta;' if it is only in the night, it is 'nakta;' if the food is taken once a day, only when it is got by chance, without begging for it, it is 'ayācita.' The last, however, seems to apply only to prāyaścittas or expiations for sins.</p>
		<p>In all, there are 24 ekādaśīs in a lunar year. They are given different names as follows:</p>

		<p>Among these, however, Āṣāḍha śukla ekādaśī called 'Śayanī' and Kārttika śukla ekādaśī named as 'Prabodhinī' are important since Viṣṇu is supposed to sleep on the Śayanī day and wake up on the Prabodhinī day, as the very names indicate. Śayanī is also called 'Prathamaikādaśī'. A very big festival is held at Phaṇḍarāpur of Maharashtra on this day. Devotees (called Vārkarīs) come from different parts and assemble in thousands to do bhajans (devotional singing).</p>
		<p>The ekādaśī of Mārgaśīrṣa śuklapakṣa is known as Vaikuṇṭha-ekādaśī. On this day, thousands of people gather in Viṣṇu temples. One of the main doors called 'Vaikuṇṭhadvāra' which is normally kept closed throughout the year, is thrown open on this day. The devotees who pass through this door for the darśana of the Lord are believed to go to Vaikuṇṭha, the abode of Viṣṇu. It is said that long back, devotee Rukmāṅgada who was being forced by an ogress to break his ekādaśī fast against the norms of the vrata was saved by Viṣṇu and was taken to Vaikuṇṭha on this day. Hence the name. There is a very big festival on this day at the Raṅganātha Temple of Śrīraṅgam in Tamil Nadu, which goes on for 21 days.</p>
		<p>This day is also the day on which the <i>Bhagavadgītā</i> was taught by the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukṣetra before the Mahābhārata war. Hence, it is celebrated as Gītājayantī even now. Apart from fasting and worship of the Gītācārya Kṛṣṇa, there will be ceremonial chanting of the text and sometimes discourses expounding the same.</p>

		<p>In the Somayāgas (Vedic sacrifices using the juice of the soma creeper for oblations) 3 to 11 earthen jugs are used to keep water collected from a running stream, early in the morning, on the very day of pressing the stalks for the juice. This is later mixed with the soma juice. The earthen jug used for this purpose has been named 'ekadhana'. It is rather difficult to give its derivative meaning.</p>

		<p>The Vedāṅgas or 'limbs of the Vedas' are important subsidiary works that help the student of the Vedas not only to understand them but also perform correctly the various rites mentioned therein. The Kalpasūtras are one of the six such Vedāṅgas.</p>
		<p>The <i>Āpastamba Kalpasūtras</i> is one of the oldest among the Kalpasūtras and belongs to the <i>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</i>. The 25th and the 26th praśnas or prapāṭhakas or sections of this work are together called <i>Ekāgnikāṇḍa</i> or <i>Mantrapāṭha</i>. Sometimes it is shown as the 31st and the 32nd sections also. There is a well-known commentary by Haradatta Miśra (A. D. 1100) on this <i>Ekāgnikāṇḍa.</i></p>
		<p>The word itself might have been derived from the fact that all the rites and rituals dealt with here, concern an average householder keeping one fire (= eka + agni), the gārhapatya fire or the gṛhyāgnī.</p>
		<p>The first chapter comprises 131 mantras spread over 18 khaṇḍas or sections; The second has 356 mantras in 22 khaṇḍas. Almost all the topics described here belong to the field of dharmaśāstras. They can be briefly stated as follows:</p>
		<p>The saṁskāras or sacraments of vivāha (marriage), upanayana (investiture with the sacred thread and allied rites), samāvartana (graduation from the gurukula), rites connected with a pregnant mother and the new born child, rites connected with the building of a new house, offering of cooked food prepared from the first agricultural crop, śrāddhas (obsequial rites), various kinds of japa, several religious rituals to offset the evils that befall one in life, other rituals to get certain desires fulfilled and a few other minor rites.</p>

		<p>Any Soma sacrifice of one day's duration (eka = one, ahan = day) is, called 'Ekāha'. It is distinguished from Ahīna and Sattra which are of longer duration. For instance, Agniṣṭoma sacrifice, which is a part of Jyotiṣṭoma, is an Ekāha. The main rite of pressing soma juice is performed here in one day.</p>

		<p>One of the aspects of the Devī or the Divine Mother, Ekajaṭā is another name for Tārā, also called 'Ugratārā'. She is so called since her jaṭā or braided hair sticks upright on the head as a single unit (eka = single). She is the terrific aspect of the Devī that killed Śumbha and Niśumbha (<i>vide Kālikā purāṇa</i> Ch. 60).</p>
		<p>She is probably the Hindu edition of a Buddhist goddess of the Vajrayāna school.</p>

	<div class="mng">
		<p>Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820) gave only the main outlines of Advaita philosophy in his writings. However, many gaps regarding the nature of the jīva, nature and locus of avidyā and māyā, the need to accept a greater degree of reality for the world to facilitate the practice of Vedāntic sādhanās had to be filled up. Later writers who dealt with these aspects developed various schools of Advaita, generally known now as 'Post-Śaṅkara Advaita'.</p>
		<p>One such school is the 'ekajīvavāda' of Prakāśānanda (A. D. 15th/16th century) propounded in his famous work <i>Vedānta-siddhānta-muktāvalī</i>. According to this theory there is only one jīva (eka = one) bound by one avidyā (nescience). Hence when his avidyā is destroyed, he is liberated. There is none else in bondage, to be liberated, since the entire world and all the other jīvas are only figments of his imagination brought about by his avidyā!</p>
		<p>This jīva is sometimes identified with Hiraṇyagarbha, the world soul.</p>
		<p>This school did not become popular. Only one writer of the later period, Jñānottama Bhaṭṭārka, has supported it in his <i>Vidyāśrī</i>, a subcommentary on the <i>Brahmasūtras</i>.</p>

		<p>Gaṇapati or Gaṇeśa, the elephant faced deity, is one of the most popular of the gods of Hinduism. His bījākṣara (the seed-letter containing his power and essence) is 'gaṁ'. That particular form which is associated with this letter and hence is to be meditated upon while repeating it, is called 'Ekākṣara-Gaṇapati'. It is one of the eight famous aspects recommended for attaining siddhis or supernatural powers.</p>
		<p>Ekākṣara-Gaṇapati is described as stout and dwarfish. He is red in colour and is seated in padmāsana or lotus posture. He carries bījāpūra (pomegranate), pāśa (lasso) and aṅkuśa (goad) in three hands, the fourth one showing the gesture of varada (bestowing boons).</p>
		<p>This form is specially worshipped to attain happiness in life.</p>

		<p>It deals with God or Brahman, the One (eka = one), who is akṣara or indestructible and is in the form of a laudatory hymn.</p>
		<p>When the sādhaka or the spiritual aspirant meditates upon Śiva, along with his consort Umā, in his sahasrāra-cakra, at the top of the head, and as one with him (Śiva), he realises his identity with Śiva who is the One without a second, and the indestructible (akṣara) reality.</p>
		<p>This Ekākṣara or the Supreme God, is the creator of this world, the lord of all beings and the primeval being. He is the protector of the world. Though unborn, he is all-pervading. He is the fire and again, he is the sacrifice.</p>
